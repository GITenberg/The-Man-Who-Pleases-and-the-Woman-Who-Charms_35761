<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The makers of books have been divided into two
classes&mdash;the creators and the collectors. In preparing
this volume the author has made no claim
to a place in the first division, for he has been, to
a great extent, only a collector. The facts which
the book contains are familiar to intelligent people,
and the only excuse offered for presenting
them in a new dress is that we need to be reminded
often of some truths with which we are most
familiar.</p>

<p>In our daily intercourse with one another, we
may forget to render to others that thoughtfulness
and attention which we exact from them.</p>

<p>We all know that the essence of courtesy is the
purpose, in speech and manner, to be agreeable,
attractive, and lovable, to awaken by our
presence happy impressions in another. We all
understand this, but we so easily forget it, or, at
least, forget to put it into practice.</p>

<p>Courtesy is not the least of the Christian virtues,
and it should be studied as an art.</p>

<p>The reader is requested to accept these chapters
in the spirit in which they were prepared. They
are not profound psychological studies, or even
original essays, but only a bringing together of
simple, yet important truths, which are of concern
to us all. Possibly they may be of some help&mdash;"Lest
we forget,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There are few subjects of deeper interest to
men and women than that of personal fascination,
or what is sometimes called "personal magnetism."
We commonly talk about it as though
it were some mysterious quality of which no
definite account could be given.</p>

<p>"A man is fascinating," we say, "he is born mag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>netic;
he has an indefinable charm which cannot
be analyzed or understood," and, with the term
"naturally magnetic," we hand the matter over
to the world of mystery.</p>

<p>Is this quality of so bewildering a nature that
it cannot be understood, or will a study of those
men and women who possess pre&euml;minently the
power of pleasing show us the secret of their influence,
and prove to us that the gift of fascination
is not, necessarily, innate, but that it can,
to a great degree, be acquired?</p>

<p>Will we not find that what appears to be the
perfection of naturalness is often but the perfection
of culture?</p>

<p>From all our well-known public men who have
won the reputation of being "naturally magnetic,"
perhaps we could not select a better example than
James G. Blaine. With the possible exception of
Henry Clay, no other political leader in our history,
under all circumstances, had so devoted and
determined a following. Both Clay and Blaine
possessed sympathetic and affectionate dispositions,
and both understood human nature and the
art of pleasing. It may be said that Mr. Blaine's
popularity was due, in a great measure, to the
brilliant and attractive nature of his public service,
and this was, no doubt, true to a certain extent.
No man knew better than he the impor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>tance
of making the most of opportunities for
dramatic and sensational display, and his methods
of statesmanship were always calculated to
please the multitude.</p>

<p>His greatest power, however, was manifested
in his winning men by direct and individual contact.
One thing which assisted him in this direction
was the fact that he was, perhaps, the most
courteous of all the public men of his generation.
Whenever a stranger was introduced to him, a
hearty handshake, a look of interest and an attentive
and cordial manner assured him that Mr.
Blaine was very glad to see him. If they chanced
to meet again, after months or even years, the man
was delighted to find that Mr. Blaine not only remembered
his name, but that he had seemed to
treasure even the most trivial recollections of
their short acquaintance. He had a marvellous
memory for faces and names, and he understood
the value of this gift.</p>

<p>This ability to remember faces is not difficult
to acquire. We could all possess it if we would
make sufficient effort. No two figures or countenances
are precisely alike, and it is by noting how
they differ one from another that you will remember
them.</p>

<p>In explaining his own remarkable memory for
faces, Thomas B. Reed once said to a reporter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that he never looked a man in the face that some
striking peculiarity, a line, a wrinkle, an expression
about the eye, the set of the lips, the shape of
the nose, something set that man's face down in
his mind indelibly, and distinguished him from the
rest of mankind.</p>

<p>Blaine carefully trained himself to pick out
some feature or peculiarity by which he could distinguish
one face or person from all others and
by which he could associate the name of the individual.</p>

<p>The ability to remember names and faces is one
of the most valuable accomplishments for the man
in public life, or, indeed, for any man or woman
who wishes social success. Not only does it insure
comfort to one's self, but it is especially pleasing
to others. Next to the comfort of being able to
address by name and without hesitation a person
one has met but once, and without mistake, is the
comfort of being recognized one's self.</p>

<p>Another reason why Mr. Blaine was popular with
the masses was because he was not difficult to approach,
and he never missed a chance to be useful
to a person who might some time, in turn, be useful
to him.</p>

<p>The <i>St. Louis Globe-Democrat</i> said shortly after
his death: "It was not the habit of Mr. Blaine to
wait for men to seek favors from him. He antici<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>pated
their desires, and doubled their obligations
to him by doing voluntarily what might have
been delayed for solicitation. That gave him the
kind of popularity which outlasts defeat and resists
all ordinary influences of criticism and hostility.
He could always count upon a certain measure of
unflinching and unconditional support, whatever
forces happened to be arrayed against him; and
he changed bitter enemies into zealous friends
with a facility that was a source of constant surprise
and wonder."</p>

<p>But why should his success in attracting others
to himself be a source of "surprise and wonder"?</p>

<p>Mr. Blaine, in common with many other magnetic
men and women, understood that the secret
of personal fascination lies in one single point;
that is, "in the power to excite in another person
happy feelings of a high degree of intensity,
and to make that person identify such feelings
with the charm and power of the cherished cause
of them."</p>

<p>Any quality, good or evil, that enables a man to
do this, renders him fascinating, whether he be
saint or sinner. Indeed, some of the men who
have been the most skilful in the art of pleasing
have been scoundrels.</p>

<p>Said a writer in the <i>Boston Herald</i>: "It used to
be said of Aaron Burr&mdash;so irresistible in charm of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
manner was the man&mdash;that he could never stop
at the stand of the ugliest old crone of an apple-woman,
without leaving on her mind when he
went away the conviction that he regarded her as
the fairest and most gracious of her sex. And so,
had woman suffrage prevailed in his day, he would
have had the solid vote of the apple-women for
any office he might aspire to."</p>

<p>Aaron Burr clearly understood that the woman
does not exist who is wholly without sentiment,
and he always appealed to that part of a woman's
nature.</p>

<p>He understood very well the truth of these words
written by Croly: "In the whole course of my
life I never met a woman, from the flat-nosed and
ebony-colored inhabitant of the tropics to the snow-white
and sublime divinity of a Greek isle, without
a touch of romance; repulsiveness could not conceal
it, age could not extinguish it, viscissitude could
not change it. I have found it in all times and
places, like a spring of fresh water, starting up
even from the flint, cheering the cheerless, softening
the insensible, renovating the withered; a
secret whisper in the ear of every woman alive
that to the last, affection might flutter its rosy
pinions around her brow."</p>

<p>Burr, understanding this, left in the mind of
the apple-woman the firm impression that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
thought she must have been at one time a duchess,
reduced in fortune by some accident, and now
driven to the last refuge of an apple-stand, and
that those sad facts evidently accounted for the
traits of high breeding and delicate refinement so
visible through all her present poverty.</p>

<p>He understood the fact that all people live in two
distinct worlds&mdash;the world of reality and the world
of imagination. In the world of reality they use
brooms and shovels, wash floors and dishes, or sell
apples; in the other, they live in drawing rooms,
feast sumptuously and are the wonder and admiration
of mankind.</p>

<p>"Few people," continues the writer in the <i>Herald</i>,
"would believe that an ugly, dilapidated looking
apple-woman could dwell in the enchanted
realm of imagination just as much as the rich and
favored do. But Burr believed it, so when he spoke
to the old crone, he went up, not to her withered
and beggarly self, but to her ideal self, imaginatively
entering into the duchess dream in her,
and instinctively became deferential in his bearing.</p>

<p>"Forthwith the duchess in her came out to meet
the courtly gentleman in him, and greetings were
exchanged as between two incognito scions of noble
lineage. Each enjoyed the meeting, each had
vividness enough of imagination to impart to it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the flavor of reality, and to keep out of sight common,
material facts."</p>

<p>"But," you say, "not every man can make such
an impression, for few are able to do and say things
with the ease and grace of a Burr. There must be
a naturalness of manner which never suggests suspicion.
Let the average man attempt to force his
nature and to manufacture smiles and looks of
pleasure, and the old apple-woman will know at
once that she is being fooled." Very true, and it
is not desirable that the average man should possess
the ability of an Aaron Burr to influence
others. Few persons try as he did to acquire that
power, but because the average man cannot at once
exercise that potent influence over others which
he did, it does not follow that we are unable to
understand the secret of Burr's success, nor is it
evident that other men cannot acquire something
of this power by thinking it worth while to do so.</p>

<p>It would not be safe to say that all men can be
equally successful, try as they will, in inspiring
in others "happy feelings of a high degree of intensity,"
for nature has not been impartial in bestowing
equally upon all the gifts of adaptation
and expression.</p>

<p>There are a few persons so constituted by temperament
and mental organism that they exercise
a depressing influence over their associates. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
have a negative, flabby spirit that seems to operate,
speaking figuratively, much as a wet shoe does
upon one who is compelled to wear it. They draw
upon the nervous strength and exhaust the patience
of those who are compelled to be much in
their company. But there are not many of this
type. Most of us could make far more progress
in acquiring social graces and in the art of pleasing
than we do.</p>

<p>Let us now consider some of the particular qualities
which render a man pleasing to the opposite
sex.</p>

<p>Of course different types of men please different
women. Some women care little for the
moral element in men. They do not admire them
for their goodness or nobility of character, but
rather for their manners and their ability to flatter
and say pleasing things. Some women are fascinated
by mere brute strength, but they are not
many. Rank, wealth, and social position are very
attractive to some, but these things do not make
the man himself more attractive to the true woman.</p>

<p>While a girl is young, she may go into raptures
over "a cameo profile, a Burnes-Jones head of hair,
or a pre-Raphaelite languor and pallor," but these
things are bound to pall, and become absolutely
distasteful. Some even admire downright wick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>edness
in men, and these are the women who send
delicacies to murderers in prison, and overwhelm
them with bouquets. But, fortunately, these types
represent but a small fraction of the fair sex, and
this chapter has to do only with the great majority;
the intelligent, moral, cultured women of the
land. What qualities in men are most attractive
to them?</p>

<p>Physical beauty is always attractive in either
sex, yet the handsome man has the advantage of
his plainer rival only in this&mdash;he is able to draw attention
to himself at once. He must, however,
have something more to hold that attention. He
may be physically an Apollo, but if he be ill-mannered,
dull or ignorant, he will stand no chance
beside the man skilled in the artful polished ways
of what is called society, who is master of that
grace of manner and flexibility of speech which
more than wealth, reputation, or personal attractiveness,
win their way with women.</p>

<p>It has been proven, again and again, that even
ugliness of face and form is not, by any means, a
bar to popularity with women, and while we are
often amazed at the choice which brilliant, beautiful
women sometimes make from a crowd of admirers,
at the bottom of every apparent fantastic
selection, there is a solid, and, usually, a sensible
reason.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>Ernest Renan was certainly not handsome. He
was exceedingly corpulent, his complexion was
said to resemble nothing else so closely as tallow.
He had claw-shaped hands, bushy gray eyebrows,
and thin gray hair, yet wherever he went into society
he was sure to be the center of an admiring
group of women. He was not fascinating by reason
of his ugliness, but in spite of it. There was
enough in the subtle charm of his manner, and
the melodious flow of his conversation, to make
up for all outward deficiencies.</p>

<p>Liszt was not a handsome man&mdash;quite the contrary;
yet probably no other man ever lived who
exercised a more magnetic and potent influence
over women. Even when he had become gaunt
and old, his eyes dim, his blonde hair snow-white,
his spare, lean figure wrapped in a black, priestly
gown, he was followed about by a train of fair
admirers.</p>

<p>Chauteaubriand could charm at eighty-four, the
Abb&eacute; Liszt at seventy-five, and Aaron Burr&mdash;who
was by no means handsome&mdash;had at seventy a
charm of manner that was irresistible.</p>

<p>The fact is, one cannot recall half a dozen very
talented men who were admired for their personal
beauty. Pope was very plain; Dr. Johnson was no
better; Mirabeau was "the ugliest man in France,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
and yet he was the greatest favorite with the fair
sex.</p>

<p>These examples are not cited to prove that
women do not care for physical beauty in men.
On the contrary, that is a very strong attraction,
but not the most powerful factor in holding them.
Women more frequently prize men for their sterling
qualities of mind than men do women. A
perfection of physical beauty rarely associates itself
with great mental ability in either sex, but
still there have been some notable exceptions, especially
among women, and every pretty woman
who reads this may consider herself one of these
exceptions.</p>

<p>As a general thing, the man who pleases is the
man who understands. It does not matter much
to a woman whether a man has great and brilliant
thoughts of his own, if he comprehends her wishes
and her feelings, as well as her thoughts. He
should, if he desires to please, make a careful
study of that mysterious and complex thing&mdash;a
woman's nature. He must understand that it is
of a finer fibre than his own; that it is sensitive
and easily hurt. He should have sentiment, but
not be a sentimentalist. He will be wise, indeed,
if he can skilfully draw the line between the two
things. "Sentiment is divine: sentimentalism absurd."
He should be able to say much in little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and he must not be a chatterer. A woman who
talks too much becomes tiresome; a man who is
an aimless talker is an intolerable bore to both
sexes.</p>

<p>Few men understand a woman. They do not
look at things from her point of view, and, therefore,
do not realize to what extent civilized life
has permitted her to assume that convention of
manner and those civilities of speech which are
in some harmless degree hypocritical. It could
not be otherwise. Her ideal of a man is a very
high one, but she rarely meets him, and so she accepts
the one who comes nearest to her ideal and
makes the most of the situation. She would that
he were different, but a woman can love in spite
of very many things. Usually she is obliged to if
to love at all. She is much cleverer at love-making
than a man. "She is an artist where he is a
crude workman, and she does not go through a love
scene without realizing how much better she could
have done it if the title r&ocirc;le had been given to
her."</p>

<p>If she is a woman of sensibility, she is shocked
by a hundred disagreeable habits which many men
think justifiable. She is repelled by awkwardness
of manner, coarse modes of speech, by carelessness
of person and dress, and yet, for all that, she loves.</p>

<p>The lover who is most successful in retaining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the affection of a sweetheart or a wife is the one
who expresses over and over again the love and
the tenderness he feels. Women, more than men,
like to hear things talked about. They are far
more wide-awake to the value of trifles, and more
sensitive to changes of mood. They are given to
saying in many ways, with delicate variations, what
a man is satisfied to state once for all, even to state
badly.</p>

<p>A man will believe in a woman's love and be
satisfied with far fewer visible tokens of it than
are necessary to confirm his tenderness and keep
her convinced of it.</p>

<p>The truth is that a man's power of pleasing does
not depend upon some occult quality of which no
account can be given, but upon the degree in which
he holds certain attractive qualities&mdash;innate or
acquired. We have no difficulty in understanding
any single one of these qualities, yet when a man
possesses such a combination of them as to entitle
him to the term "fascinating" we pronounce it incomprehensible,
and fall back upon that vague
term, "personal magnetism."</p>

<p>The personal elements which are most conducive
to our influence over others are, in a broad way:
good manners, a pleasing voice, the ability to converse
well, personal neatness, taste in dress, tact,
good morals, culture and refinement, physical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
beauty, and intellectual force. We are pleasing
or offensive just in proportion to our possession of
these very desirable characteristics, and, possibly,
what we term "personal magnetism" is simply the
result of a well-balanced development of some, or
all, of these enviable characteristics.</p>

<h2>THE WOMAN WHO CHARMS.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Look on this woman. There is not beauty, not
brilliant sayings, nor distinguished power to serve
you; but all see her gladly; her whole air and impression
are healthful. Manners require time, as
nothing is more vulgar than haste.</i></p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Emerson.</span></p>

<p><i>Possessed with such a gentle, sovereign grace,<br />
With such enchanting presence and discourse.</i></p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Comedy of Errors.</span></p>

<p><i>She's a most exquisite lady.</i></p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Othello.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Is it the handsome woman? Yes, sometimes, but
not always. Beauty is always attractive, but the
handsome woman has the same advantage only
that the handsome man possesses&mdash;she draws attention
to herself at once. If she has nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
but her beauty to rely upon, she does not hold the
attention.</p>

<p>It was Balzac who reminded us of the fact that
nearly all of the most celebrated attachments in
history were inspired by women in whom there
were noticeable physical defects. Mme. de Pompadour,
Joanna of Naples, Cleopatra, La Valliere&mdash;in
fact, almost all the women whom a romantic
love has invested with a halo of interest&mdash;were
not without imperfections and even infirmities,
while nearly all the women whose beauty is described
to us as perfect, have been finally unhappy
in their loves.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," says Balzac, "men live by sentiment
more than by pleasure. Perhaps the charm, wholly
physical, of a beautiful woman has its bounds,
while the charm, essentially moral, of a woman of
moderate beauty may be infinite."</p>

<p>Whether this be true or not, women surely overestimate
the influence of mere physical beauty to
attract and hold men. Madame de Sta&euml;l, whose
dominion over the hearts of all those with whom
she came in contact is well known, declared that
she would gladly give up all her gifts of person,
and all her learning, if she could receive beauty in
exchange. It was fortunate for her that her wish
was not granted, for, had it been, probably she
would have found her kingdom slipping away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
While she did not have a beautiful face, she possessed
physical characteristics and personal traits
which rendered her absolutely fascinating.</p>

<p>To a sensible man nothing is quite so insipid as
a vain, brainless, tactless beauty, whose opinions
are but echoes, and who imagines that her beauty
alone will hold him chained to her chariot.</p>

<p>Beauty holds for a time, but after a man's eyes
are satisfied, he must be entertained, and the plain
girl who possesses brains and tact need have no fear
of her more beautiful rival. Modern research has
proved that not Sappho, not Aspasia, nor even
Cleopatra were women who would have attracted
any special attention by reason of their physical
beauty. Their highest charm was intellectual&mdash;the
possession of an "immensity to give," as Plutarch
expresses it, in the way of grace and accomplishment.</p>

<p>The idea that plain girls are allowed to run to
waste as "unappropriated blessings," is not supported
by evidence, for we are constantly meeting
wives far plainer than the majority of the unmarried
women of our acquaintance; and it frequently
happens that a man who has a wife physically beautiful,
becomes enamored of an exceedingly plain
woman who possesses a certain quality of congeniality,
some trait of adaptability which he misses
in his partner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Says a writer in <i>Lippincott's</i>: "It is safe to
make the broad generalization that a homely girl,
all other things being equal, is likely to have
fewer offers than a pretty girl, but quite as likely
to receive the one offer which will make her a happy
wife. But all other things (save the gift of beauty)
seldom are equal between the homely and the
pretty girl; by the natural law of compensation, the
homely girl has either some inherent or some acquired
ability that is lacking in the other, which
asserts its charm as acquaintance progresses.
Beauty only has the start in the race."</p>

<p>It frequently happens that the beauty makes the
mistake of expecting to be entertained by her admirers,
and does not exert herself to please. The
plain girl, however, is often superior in tact, for
being obliged to study human nature closely in order
to get the most out of companionship, she
learns to depend upon this knowledge in her efforts
to please. She is not dazzled by admiration,
nor is she unduly confident when she obtains
it that she will retain it.</p>

<p>Mme. Hading, who is a strikingly handsome
woman, and, therefore, can discuss beauty without
falling under suspicion, once said:</p>

<p>"A woman is very unfortunate who has nothing
but beauty to insure her success. There are other
things superior to beauty. Taste, good taste,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
brains, tact, health, those are the things a woman
must have to hold people. And then there are
good manners&mdash;so rare and yet so easily cultivated.
To be refined, to be gentle, to be amiable, to be
charitable in thought and in speech, to be intelligent,
is to be charming, in spite of an unattractive
body and an ugly face. To be well born is, indeed,
to be blessed, but to rise above low birth is sublime.
The greatest painter of the age could make only a
caricature of a face for the Empress Josephine,
and yet the sweetness of her smile and the charm
of her pleasing and gracious ways immortalized
her name. There are other ends to happiness than
mere wealth; there are sweeter things in a woman's
face than beauty."</p>

<p>Again, the woman who charms is not necessarily
young. History is full of accounts of women
who have been fascinating when beyond middle
life. The truest and strongest love is not always
inspired by the beauty of twenty. The enthusiasm
over sweet sixteen is not supported by the old experience
which teaches that the highest beauty is
not found in immaturity. Louis XIV. wedded
Mme. Maintenon when she was forty-three years
old. Catherine II. of Russia was thirty-three when
she seized the Empire of Russia and captivated the
dashing young Gen. Orloff. Even up to the time
of her death&mdash;at sixty-seven&mdash;she seemed to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
retained the same bewitching power, for the lamentations
were heartfelt among all those who had
ever known her personally.</p>

<p>Cleopatra was considerably over thirty when Antony
fell under her spell, which never lessened until
her death, nearly ten years later.</p>

<p>Livia was thirty-three when she won the heart
of Augustus, over whom she maintained her ascendancy
until the last. Aspasia did not wed
Pericles until she was thirty-seven, and for more
than thirty years after that she was regarded as
one of the most fascinating women of her time.
Ninon de l'Enclos, the most celebrated wit of her
day, was the idol of three generations of the golden
youth of France, and she was seventy-two when
the Abb&eacute; de Berais fell in love with her.</p>

<p>Helen of Troy, the celebrated Greek beauty, was
over forty-five when she took part in the most famous
elopement in history; and as the siege of
Troy lasted ten years, she must have been at least
fifty-five when the ill-fortune of Paris restored
her to her husband, who is reported to have received
her with unquestioned love and gratitude.
Mlle. Mars, the celebrated actress, was most attractive
at forty-five, and Mme. R&eacute;camier was at the
zenith of her good looks and of her power to please
when between thirty-five and fifty-five. Diana de
Poitiers was over thirty-six when Henry II., then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Duke of Orleans, and just half her age, became attached
to her, and she was regarded as the first
lady and the most beautiful woman at court up to
the time of the monarch's death and the accession
to power of Catherine de Medici.</p>

<p>The common idea that the mature beauty of
forty is less fascinating than that of the girl of
seventeen or eighteen is without foundation. By
beauty is not meant merely well-formed features
and a fresh complexion&mdash;these things even dolls
possess. In spite of the rosy, fresh complexion bestowed
upon youth by nature, a woman's best and
richest age is really between thirty-five and forty-five,
and sometimes considerably beyond that period.</p>

<p>No one would dare say how old Madame Patti
is. Everyone who meets her exclaims at her marvellous
youthfulness and vivacity. Patti's explanation
of her bright eyes, smooth skin and happy
expression is given in a few words: "I have kept
my temper. No woman can remain young who
often loses her temper."</p>

<p>As a woman grows older, she ought to become
more attractive in certain ways than she could be
in her youth. One of the most needful things for
attaining this result is good health. Fine muscles,
a healthy, glowing skin, eyes bright with energy
and ambition&mdash;these make a valuable foundation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
for the woman who would be attractive. The
woman who, at a certain age, considers herself
<i>pass&eacute;</i>, commits a great error. If she so regards
herself; if she believes she has passed the time
when she can be interesting, others are quite likely
to find her unattractive. Surely a woman should
be more interesting after she leaves the period of
girlhood. She ought to be able to converse better,
she should possess more wisdom, greater tact,
broader knowledge of human nature; and she
should have more repose, more grace of manner.
Indeed, she should have all her accomplishments
well in hand, and be more facile in their use for
the pleasure of others; and she will be able to use
them to better advantage if she has cultivated placidity
of temper, human sympathy and generosity,
and is not careless of her personal appearance.
It frequently happens that women who have
reached middle life neglect many of the aids to
physical beauty which they once carefully followed.
They are careless about dress, and grow to esteem
it excusable to dispense with those simple and necessary
accessories of the toilet which formerly
helped to make them so exquisitely fresh and dainty.
They grow accustomed to think that untidiness
must necessarily be associated with drudgery. But
in these days it is becoming more possible to carry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the element of refinement and beauty with us
everywhere.</p>

<p>Many women could seem much finer, more delicate
than they appear, if they were not accustomed
to think that a certain homeliness, and
even negligence of attire is quite excusable, and,
indeed, almost inseparable from common work-a-day
life. As we grow older, it becomes more necessary
that we use care in always presenting that
appearance of personal neatness which never fails
to be attractive to those with whom we come in
contact.</p>

<p>One of the strongest elements a woman can possess
to attract the other sex is a sympathetic interest
in a man's work. This was what attracted Dr.
Schliemann, the famous Greek scholar and explorer,
to the young woman whom he married.
She was familiar with the Iliad and the Odyssey,
and was an enthusiast upon the subject of uncovering
the ancient cities of Homer.</p>

<p>Men like to have women interested in the things
in which they themselves are interested.</p>

<p>One who has read Richard Harding Davis' "Soldiers
of Fortune" may remember that Clay grew
very fond of Miss Langham. His first disappointment
in her came to him when he discovered her
lack of interest in his work of opening up the iron
mines in South America. Miss Langham's younger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
sister, Hope, was, on the other hand, extremely interested
in the mines, made an exhaustive study
of the methods of mining, and when she, with the
other members of the family, visited the scene of
Clay's engineering operations, it was she who
drew Clay's attention to herself by intelligent
questions and suggestive remarks. He was delighted
with her, admired her, fell in love with her,
and then married her. That day at the mines was
the beginning of the end of the old love, and the
awakening of the new.</p>

<p>To interest men a woman should, by reading the
papers, acquire, and be able to express, a reasonably
clear idea of what is happening in the world.
She should ascertain what is of special interest
to the particular man she wishes to attract, and,
whether the subject be politics, business, out-door
sports, art, science, or literature, she should be
able to contribute something in a conversation
upon that subject more interesting than a mere
yes or no.</p>

<p>As it is the manly man who wins and satisfies
a good woman, so it is the womanly woman who
pleases and retains the regard of the estimable
man.</p>

<p>Men like the womanly woman. She need not be
soft or silly, weak or nervous; she may be strong,
vigorous, resolute, and brave. A man has little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
sympathy for the girl who imitates men either in
dress, manner or conversation. If a womanly man
is not pleasing to either sex, what shall we say of
a manlike woman!</p>

<p>He thoroughly expresses the writer's view who
said: "A perfect woman may be adorable; a woman
who is perfect would be beyond endurance." Yet,
however irreligious a man may be himself, he always
dislikes irreverence in a woman. He wishes
and expects his wife to be better than he is, and,
generally, she is.</p>

<p>Men do not like the over-dressed woman&mdash;the
one who goes to the extreme of a fashion and a little
further. He does not care for costliness of apparel,
but he is always attracted by freshness and
daintiness.</p>

<p>A sense of humor is a valuable gift in a woman
who wishes to please. Men like the girl who sees
the funny side of a thing; who can make them
laugh; who can be witty without being sarcastic;
who can jest and not be malicious; who can relate
humorous experiences without saying things calculated
to make others uncomfortable.</p>

<p>A man likes a woman who entertains and amuses
him. Young girls often express surprise that one
of their number is so popular among men. They
know she is not so pretty as dozens of other girls.
She is not dressed so richly as they are, yet, at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
party, she will have half a dozen young men about
her while they are neglected and alone. She must,
they conclude, have that indefinable quality of
magnetism, and that is all that can be said about
it, and they could not find out the secret if they
tried. But probably there is no secret about it.
Although she is not pretty, and does not possess a
vast amount of information, she has tact, and a
quick and electric vivacity of spirit which acts as
a breeze on the sluggish waters, making ripples of
pleasure and laughter, and so produces an exhilarating
effect upon all about her.</p>

<p>Many young men, if diffident or awkward, feel,
it may be, a little out of place. They hardly know
what to do or say, but this particular girl wakes
them up, and they find themselves laughing and
talking with astonishing ease. She understands
how to make them feel at ease, how to draw them
out, and as they associate with her they become
unusually elated, and it is not at all strange that
in every company they look eagerly for her presence.</p>

<p>While, judging from the descriptions and representations
which we have of her, Cleopatra was
by no means beautiful, there is no mystery about
her fascinating influence over men.</p>

<p>"She had," said a writer in <i>The Boston Herald</i>,
"jaded Roman conquerors to deal with, men sated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
with every form of mere animal pleasure. There
was no piquancy left in anything; all had palled
and staled on their cloyed palates. But in Cleopatra
was evermore something fresh, unexpected,
perfectly original!</p>

<p>"No wonder the bystanders cried, 'Age cannot
wither nor custom stale her infinite variety.' What
had she to fear from the rivalship of mere youth
and beauty so long as her nimble intellect was fertile,
like the Nile floods, in successive harvests,
in the one quality her lovers were ready to lavish
kingdoms for, namely, 'infinite variety.'"</p>

<p>To go back to the definition of personal fascination
given in the preceding chapter, we repeat that
it consists "in the power to excite in another person
happy feelings of a high degree of intensity,
and to make that person identify such feelings with
the charm and power of the cherished cause of
them."</p>

<p>There may be such a thing as the "indefinite
quality of magnetism" which draws people to the
possessor whether they will or no; but there are
many personalities who are charming because they
have willed to be, because by painstaking perseverance
they have acquired those characteristics which
enable them to please and charm all with whom
they come in contact.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Sigourney.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The man or woman who is an intelligent, tactful
conversationalist, commands one of the most
essential elements of a pleasing address. While
all of us may have certain defects which we cannot
wholly overcome, however earnestly we may try,
we can, if we will, re-form our conversation. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
can so train ourselves that good nature, considerateness
and benevolence will always have a place
in our intercourse with others. We can, if we will,
use good English, and we can avoid the temptation,
so common, to talk of persons rather than of
things. Theoretically, we despise gossip; practically,
most of us add our mite to the common
fund. We may not be ill-natured, and the sweet
charity that "thinketh no evil" may have a home
in our hearts; yet sometimes, if we are not watchful,
it may fall asleep, and bitterness, or the spirit
of spitefulness come creeping stealthily to the surface.</p>

<p>We can, if we will, be intellectually honest&mdash;a
kind of honesty which is indeed rare. The principal
reason why arguments and discussions lead to
so must dissatisfaction and ill-feeling on the part
of the disputants, is the lack of this quality.</p>

<p>Two men are engaged in conversation and a
question of religious belief or of politics is brought
to the front. Each takes a side in the discussion
and maintains his opinions to the end. Neither
is searching for the truth, but is eager to defend
his side of the question against the attacks of
his opponent. It does not occur to either that
anything else can be the truth except the things
he has been taught to believe. To both, the truth
simply takes the form of their own opinions; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
since they are most firmly attached to their opinions,
neither ever questions his own devotion to
the truth. Such persons can scarcely be said to
use their minds at all, for their thinking has been
done by some one else. Many a hostess is
obliged tactfully to separate aggressively argumentative
and disputatious guests, who have never
learned that others have an equal right to their
own opinions, and that not every dinner party is
the proper occasion to plunge into heated argument
in the hope of changing another's views.</p>

<p>Again, we can all avoid the habit of exaggeration&mdash;a
fault which does not get itself called by
the name of "falsehood," but which is in dangerously
close proximity to it. A man hears something,
true enough in its original shape, but he
passes it on with a little addition of his own.
The one to whom he tells it adds his touch of exaggeration,
until, at last, the statement is so
swollen and distorted as to convey anything but
the real truth. It would be difficult to charge any
one with deliberate prevarication. The result is a
sort of accumulative lie, made by successive individual
contributions of little dashes of exaggeration.
Thousands who would never be guilty of inventing
an entire story derogatory to the reputation
of another, are constantly contributing to the
formation of these accumulative falsehoods, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
are quite as evil in their results as though conceived
and concocted by one person.</p>

<p>We can put into requisition a nice sense of
honor in our conversation. In a hundred different
ways this most fitting attribute of the true woman
and the real gentleman is often put to the test.
We can remember that it is quite as easy to be
ill-mannered in speech as in conduct.</p>

<p>There are men and women who, at a dinner,
would not under any circumstances, transgress
the rules of table etiquette, but who may offend
quite as grossly by a thoughtless or an intemperate
use of words. They may not dispense with
the fork, but they wound the heart by unkind
words. They may observe all the amenities from
oyster-fork to finger-bowl, yet they offend some
member of the company by sarcasm or personal
innuendo. They may not misplace or misuse the
napkin, but they may render the entire company
uncomfortable by declining to yield, in argument,
to the greater weight of evidence; or by overloading
a story with unimportant details. They may
be scrupulously neat, and of easy and graceful
deportment, but may never have learned the gentle
art of keeping one's temper sweet when criticised
or when confronted by a contradiction.</p>

<p>These very suggestive words appeared in "The
Churchman": "It is almost a definition of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
gentleman to say that he is one who never inflicts
pain. The true gentleman carefully avoids
whatever may cause a jar or a jolt in the minds of
those with whom he is cast. He has his eyes on
all his company; he is tender toward the bashful,
gentle toward the distant, and merciful toward the
absurd. He avoids unreasonable allusions on topics
which may irritate; he is seldom prominent in
conversation, and never wearisome. Another delightful
trait in him is that he makes light of
favors when he bestows them, and seems to be receiving
when he is conferring. He never speaks of
himself except when compelled, never defends himself
by a mere retort. He has no ears for slander
or gossip; is scrupulous in imputing motives to
those who interfere with him, and interprets everything
for the best. He is never mean or small in
his disputes, never insinuates evil which he dare
not say out. He has too much good sense to be
affronted at insults, and is too well employed to
remember injuries. He may be right or wrong in
his opinions, but he is too clear-headed to be unjust.
He is as simple as he is forcible, and as brief
as he is decisive."</p>

<p>The entertaining talker is not, of necessity, a
great talker; he is often a good listener. He understands
that a bright story, briefly told, will
amuse, but that people are bored by a long story,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
filled with pointless details. He is not necessarily
learned or profound. He understands that small
change is of as much importance in social intercourse
as it is between men in business. "Although
deprecated by some wise people as vain and frivolous,"
says <i>Zion's Herald</i>, "small talk has a legitimate
function in human intercourse. It is the
small coin of conversation. Those who despise its
use often get on as badly in social life as would
the merchant who should exclude the dimes and
quarters from his money-drawer. Without them,
the wheels of trade would be blocked. An honest
old copper penny will often turn the corner of a
good bargain. Chit-chat gives ease to conversation.
The strait-jacket is removed; the mental
forces have full play; the man acts himself; and
the communication of soul with soul becomes free
and delightful. With small talk he is familiar,
and can toss it about as a juggler does his cards.
The philosopher with his learned and exact
phrases at once deadens the flow of soul."</p>

<p>Men and women are not strictly original. The
things we say to-day have been said just as well
a thousand times before; but that forms no reason
why we should not say them again. The coins in
your purse have been through a hundred hands
and are not the less useful in serving you again.</p>

<p>The fellowship enjoyed rather than the store<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
of wisdom communicated, is the end of conversation.
Whether they say anything of importance
or not, we like to hear some persons talk; they inspire
us and set our own mental machinery in motion.
Small talk often brings us most readily in
contact with another soul.</p>

<p>All good conversationalists know the use of small
talk. To be sure, they know something more,
something larger and better, but the chinks in the
larger subject are filled in wonderfully by a familiar
interpolation of the smaller things in a chatty
way. Many a wise and learned man would be a
better talker if he had at hand a supply of small
coin. He can talk extremely well on serious and recondite
subjects, but the quick jest and easy repartee
of the parlor and the dining-room are beyond
him. He is, in spite of his learned lore, at a disadvantage
in society, where there is no time for
homilies or for treatises on erudite topics. Persons
less gifted chat and laugh and have a good
time while he sits in gloomy silence. Those who
would please and be pleased in social intercourse
must carry with them and be ready to dispense the
small change of light and witty conversation.</p>

<p>To be popular in society, find out whether your
companion prefers to talk or listen; avoid personalities;
endeavor to lead the conversation to subjects
familiar and interesting to others rather than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
especially pleasing to yourself; never indulge in
sarcasm; be good-natured and sympathetic; strive
to be tactful; exchange small courtesies; talk to
all with equal attention and interest, and whatever
the topic of conversation, or wherever you may be,
appear cheerfully contented. Acquire, and then
exhibit, that adaptability to place and people
which conduces ever to grateful and pleasing
companionship.</p>

<p>William Mathews writes in <i>Success</i>: "Conversation
rules the destiny of the state and of the individual;
from diplomacy, which is essentially the
art of conversing skilfully on political themes,
down to the daily transactions of the mart and
the exchange, its empire is evident to all.</p>

<p>"Such being the potency and importance of conversation,
why is so little attention given to its culture
to-day? Why is it that so many educated men,
who are fastidious regarding their personal appearance,
and bestow upon their bodies the most
solicitous care, are yet willing to send their minds
abroad in a state of slovenliness, regardless of the
impression they make?"</p>

<p>An accomplishment, in its accepted meaning, is
"something acquired which perfects or makes complete;
an attainment which tends to equip in character,
manner, or person, and which gives pleasure
to others."</p>

<p>Surely, then, the man or woman who desires
to please cannot possess too many accomplishments;
and, accepting the definition just given, is
there any other accomplishment of greater importance
than facility in speaking and writing one's
native language with ease and with elegance? Is
there any other single test of culture so conclusive
as this? Is it not the matter, and, particularly,
the method of one's speech more than anything
else which impresses the person whom we meet
for the first time, either favorably or unfavorably
in regard to our acquirements? We may have but
few opportunities during a lifetime to display our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
knowledge of geometry, algebra or astronomy; we
may be for weeks in the company of other people
without giving them an opportunity to suspect that
we possess any knowledge of Latin or Greek, but
as long as we live, and every day we live, we are
giving evidences of facility or awkwardness in the
use of our mother tongue.</p>

<p>How much time is wasted in practicing upon
unresponsive musical instruments&mdash;unresponsive
because not touched by sympathetic fingers! How
much time is spent in acquiring a slight knowledge
of French and German, which results, generally, in
an ability to use a few simple phrases, and to translate
easy sentences with the aid of a dictionary!
How many young women, with no artistic ability
whatever, spend weeks and months under the instruction
of teachers in vain attempts to produce
something in oil or in water-color worthy to be
called a picture! How much more to the advantage
of these young women would it be if a part
of this time were spent in acquiring a better understanding
of the use of English!</p>

<p>The writer once knew a girl who, after playing
a selection upon the piano, left the room and burst
into tears because she had been guilty of a slight
blunder in her execution&mdash;a blunder not noticed
by two of the twenty persons assembled in the parlor.
This same girl, however, exhibited, habitual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>ly,
a carelessness in pronunciation, and an ignorance
of English grammar of which she should
have been heartily ashamed, and which caused
far more annoyance to her friends than her blunders
in music.</p>

<p>Boys and girls should be trained to feel that it
is as discreditable to them to confound the parts
of speech in conversation, as it is to make discords
in music, or to finish a picture out of drawing, or
to be guilty of some inadvertence of manner. They
should be made to feel that proficiency in music,
French, German, or painting, or any other accomplishment,
so-called, will not compensate for
slovenliness of diction.</p>

<p>In addressing a girl's school, Bishop Huntington
once said: "Probably there is not an instrument
in common use, from a pencil to a piano, which
is used so imperfectly as language. If you will
let me be plain, I suspect that it would be safe
to offer a gold medal as a prize to any young lady
here who will not, before to-morrow night, utter
some sentence that cannot be parsed; will put no
singulars and plurals in forbidden connections;
will drop no particles, double no negatives, mix
no metaphors, tangle no parentheses; begin no
statement two or three times over without finishing
it; and not once construct a proposition after
this manner:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>"When a person talks like that, they ought to
be ashamed of it.'"</p>

<p>These are frank statements to address to a
class of young ladies; but the Bishop's implication
would hold with equal truth not only in the case
in point, but also with a large number of the high
schools, seminaries and colleges of this country.
Surely such a charge against the other practical
branches of study could not be made and sustained.</p>

<p>When James Russell Lowell said: "We are the
most common-schooled and the least educated people
in the world," he might have added that the
statement was especially applicable to our habits
of using or abusing our mother tongue.</p>

<p>This general indifference to good English is not,
in most instances, the result of a lack of knowledge,
for time enough is devoted to the study of
technical grammar in almost all schools, to enable
the pupil to become thoroughly acquainted with
the principles which govern the use of our language.</p>

<p>It is because many persons, not having acquired
the habit of correct speech, do not think to apply
the rules of grammar in conversation. Were children
accustomed from infancy to hear only correct
English, there would be but little need to memorize
arbitrary rules of grammar, for they would,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
from habit, speak and write correctly. Thus it is
that the children of educated parents are generally
so easy and graceful in their conversation, contrasted
with the children of the uneducated. Our
language, like our manners, is caught from those
with whom we associate.</p>

<p>Several other nations are far in advance of our
own in the thoroughness with which their youth
are drilled in the use of language.</p>

<p>In France, a knowledge of the French language,
spoken and written, is regarded as of special importance.
In all entrance examinations, or examinations
for promotion or graduation, the pupil's
knowledge of his native tongue is first determined;
and no promotions are allowed, and no
diplomas granted, if the student is notably deficient
in this regard, even though his knowledge
of the other required branches should prove to
be all that could be desired. We have not so high
a standard in the United States. It has been but
a few years since a definite knowledge of English
was added to the requirements for admission to
American colleges, and even now it has not, in
any of our educational institutions, the relative
weight in determining examinations which French
and German have in the systems of those countries.
While great improvement has been made in teaching
English, and while better methods are em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>ployed
than formerly, it is still safe to say that in
no other branch of study, pursued with equal diligence,
are the results so unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Surely in no other way do we so clearly show the
degree of our culture and refinement as by our
every-day conversation. Is it not important, then,
that we devote our efforts seriously, and with infinite
patience, if necessary, to mastering a matter
so essential?</p>

<p>The selection of good English does not necessarily
imply either a stilted monotony of speech, or a
tiresome affectation. It is simply elegance and
naturalness. There is no reason why any person,
however humble his station in life, should
not hope to speak his native language correctly.
It is an accomplishment which is not expensive.
In its acquirement one does not require high-priced
teachers. It demands only care and attention.
Be critical of yourself. Watch your sentences.
Get your companions to correct your slips of the
tongue. Say over correctly the troublesome sentence
until the mistake becomes impossible. Listening
to well educated persons and reading the
best literature are both of great assistance in this
direction, especially if we offer to both the sincere
flattery of imitation. Our literature teems
with masterpieces of style. To read them consistently
is to imbibe a certain facility of diction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>There are many persons who, while they do not
violate the rules of technical grammar, habitually
indulge in slang, hyperbole, and in many "weeds
of speech" which should be pulled up promptly
and cast aside. A great many boys and girls, and
even some older persons, imagine that the use of
slang lends piquancy and force to their conversation.
Slang is always an element of weakness. It
is bad enough in a man, but in women it is far
more questionable. It is not the expression of
the refined. To the cultivated taste it is discordant.</p>

<p>Another fault prevalent among girls is the habit
of hyperbole. Perfectly, awfully, nice, and splendid,
are the four most overworked words, and awfully
is the most abused of them all. It is strange,
the hold this word has secured in the vocabulary
of girls who, in almost all other respects, are
considerate in their use of English. Persons are
called awfully good, awfully bad, awfully clever,
awfully stupid, awfully nice, awfully jolly and
awfully kind. It is made to do duty on all occasions
and under all circumstances, as though it
were the only adverb admissible in good society.
Among adjectives, splendid easily ranks as the
most popular. To many, everything is splendid,
whether it is a flower, a sunset, a dinner, a football
game, a friend, a sermon, or a book. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
we are continually hearing that certain things are
<i>perfectly</i> splendid, <i>perfectly</i> lovely, <i>perfectly</i> hateful,
<i>perfectly</i> glorious, <i>perfectly</i> magnificent and
<i>perfectly</i> sweet. How word-stricken society would
do without these expressions it is difficult to determine,
yet certain it is that the woman who
deals recklessly in superlatives demonstrates forthwith
that her judgment is dominated by her impulses,
that her opinions are of doubtful reliability,
and her criticisms valueless.</p>

<p>In a recent number of one of the popular magazines
Prof. Brander Matthews has an article on
the prevailing indifference in regard to the proper
use of words. The points which he emphasizes
are these:</p>

<p>The gentleman is never indifferent, never reckless
in his language. The sloven in speech is
quite as offensive as a sloven in manner and dress.
The neat turning of a phrase is as agreeable to
the ear as neatness of person is to the refined taste.
A man should choose his words at least as carefully
as he chooses his clothing; even a hint of the
dandy is not objectionable, if it be but a hint.
It is even better to go to the extreme of fastidiousness
than to indulge the opposite extreme of negligence.</p>

<p>The art of writing letters is but another phase
of the same matter. Indeed it is but conversation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
carried on with the pen, when distance or circumstances
prevent the easier method of exchanging
ideas by spoken words. It is an art which should
be faithfully cultivated by those who desire to
please. In social life, in business, in almost every
other circumstance of life, we find our pen called
into requisition. Yet while it is an almost indispensable
accomplishment, it is one which is
pitifully neglected. The art of letter-writing is
becoming obsolete; that is, the art of writing such
letters as enriched the epistolary literature of a
former generation. This is unfortunate, as there
is nothing that will so stimulate thought, and
bring into activity, practical, every-day niceties of
phrase as the exercise of this art. Constant drill
in letter-writing will tend to take from one's
vocabulary words which have no place there, and
will accomplish quite as much as any other means
to broaden, beautify, and to refine the language at
our command, as well as to train the mind to exact
habits of thinking. A further important consideration
is the charm which "a gem of a letter"
has for the delighted recipient.</p>

<p>The indispensable requisites of a good letter are
neatness of chirography, simplicity, and grammatical
correctness. Defects in any one of these
particulars are scarcely pardonable. We cannot
all be pretty writers, but we can all write legibly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and give to the page the appearance of neatness.
Scribbling is inexcusable.</p>

<p>"A scribbled page points to a scribbling mind,
while clear, legible handwriting is not only an
indication of clear thinking, but a means and promoter
of accurate thought. Indeed, simply as a
business proposition, one cannot afford to become
a slovenly penman."</p>

<p>"And who," says <i>The Philadelphia Record</i>, "does
not know the charm of a gracefully worded, legibly
written letter, with its wide margins, its clear,
black ink and dainty stationery? An art, indeed,
is the writing of such a missive; an art which it
behooves every woman to cultivate. A hastily
written line betraying signs of carelessness, and
scrawled on an indifferent sheet of paper is a poor
compliment, indeed, to the receiver, and elicits
anything but flattering comments upon the writer."</p>

<p>Careless speech is quite bad enough, but the
charm of the speaker may be so great as to disarm
criticism. The letter, however, the written
word, stands on its own merits; "what is writ is
writ." There is no graceful vivacity to plead for
the writer; no coquetry of manner to distract the
glance of the reader from the errors coldly set
forth in black and white. Observe, then, the utmost
care in inditing an epistle, whether to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
friend or foe or to a lover. Never send forth a
letter in undress, so to speak, scarcely more than
you would present yourself <i>en dishabille</i> before
your most formal acquaintances. The one is almost
as flagrant as the other.</p>

<p><i>Brilliancy in conversation is to the company

</div>

<p>Seldom does there occur in society any lapse
so astonishing as the uncomfortable remarks innocently
made by men and women to each other.
Some persons who are careful and considerate in
other respects, seem to have a woeful lack of that
quality which we call tact. They wish to be pleasing;
they would not for the world intentionally
say or do anything to injure or wound the sensitiveness
of a friend; yet they are continually say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>ing
those "things that would better have been
left unsaid."</p>

<p><i>Harper's Bazar</i> mentions some of these speeches
which have no excuse for being.</p>

<p>"What a dear little fellow that is!" said a caller
to the mother of a three-year-old.</p>

<p>"He is a great comfort to us," replied the
mother, stroking the child's long curls.</p>

<p>"Yes; I should think so. He is not pretty, is
he? His hair is so beautiful now that at the first
glance one would call him pretty. But if you
imagine how he will look when those golden curls
are cut off, you will see that he will be a very plain
child."</p>

<p>Said another woman to an acquaintance: "Mrs.
A., I hope you will pardon me for saying that I
think I never saw a more beautiful piece of lace
than the flounce on the gown that you wore to the
Assembly Ball last week. I said to my husband
afterward that if Mr. A. should fail again and lose
everything, as he has done once or twice already,
you could sell that lace and easily get a good price
for it."</p>

<p>The same woman, while making a visit of several
weeks, said to her hostess, as the time of her departure
drew near: "I always think that the nicest
thing about making a visit is the returning to
one's home. One's family are always so glad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to see one, and there is always great luxury to me
in getting back to my own house, where I can do
what I please, say what I please, and order what
I want to eat."</p>

<p>Again, there are people who seem to think that
it is their mission to puncture every person's infirmity
with whom they come in contact. They
study to speak disagreeably. They corner you in
the social circle, and talk about the subject they
know to be most disagreeable to you, and talk in
a tone sufficiently loud to be heard by all the
other persons in the room. If you have made a
blunder they reveal it. If you have been unsuccessful
in any of your undertakings they are sure
to inquire about it, even to details. They unroll
your past and dilate upon your future. They
put you on the rack every time you meet them and
there is an instinctive recoil when you perceive
their approach.</p>

<p>"We all know these persons," says <i>Zion's
Herald</i>, "the persons who always utter the unsuitable
word, who make themselves generally disagreeable,
who never, apparently, try to make a
pleasing impression upon others, but who delight
to sting and wound."</p>

<p>Are we not all acquainted with the neighbor
mentioned in this quotation: "As a brief and sharp
tormentor, as a nail in the boot, a rocker for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
shins on a dark night, or a sharp angle for the
ulnar nerve, Mrs. R&mdash;&mdash;, our neighbor, excels
all persons I ever saw. I am quite sure if she
could disturb a corpse by whispering to it that its
shroud was ill-fitting, and the floral gifts were not
what had been expected, she would do it."</p>

<p>If you are a woman have you not more than
once gone out for a walk with some other woman
who is never satisfied with your appearance?</p>

<p>She gives your gown a pull, saying: "This dress
never did fit you; it isn't at all becoming to you,
why didn't you wear your other one?" You soon
begin to feel uncomfortable, and to wish you were
at home again. Your bonnet may be never so becoming,
or your new jacket may fit you to perfection,
but she never mentions either. She notices
only defects; she sees all that is disagreeable.
Such persons always leave an uncomfortable feeling
behind them when they leave you.</p>

<p>Sarcasm is not a quality to be cultivated by
either sex. Men do not like it in women. It
may be amusing when it is directed against another,
but there is always a lurking fear that it
may some time be directed against one's self. Sarcasm
is a rank weed, that, once sprouted, grows
and grows, choking out the little plants of kindness,
forethought and consideration, until it overruns
the garden of the mind, dominating and con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>trolling
every thought with a disagreeable, pungent
odor that cannot be eradicated.</p>

<p>The sarcastic girl is not fascinating, for she is
not a pleasing companion. She is too sharp to
be agreeable. She may possess talent above the
average of her acquaintances; she may be able to
talk in half a dozen different languages; she may
be as beautiful as a Greek statue; but men fight
shy of her. Sarcasm is not wit, though wit
may be sarcastic. One may be bright and say all
manner of clever things without hurting the feelings
of others by keen, knife-edged opinions that
are full of bitterness and teeming with gall.</p>

<p>The tactful person does not make the mistake
of talking too much about himself. While we are
young, at least, we are very interesting to ourselves,
and we are likely to imagine that all the
world is interested in our opinions, prejudices and
tastes. But though this may be true of our dearest
friends, it is not true as far as other people are
concerned.</p>

<p>"Without question," says the <i>Magnet</i>, "our conversation
must be based upon what we have experienced
in one way or another. But that does
not make it necessary for us to talk continually
about ourselves. If we should examine carefully
the things we say to the merest acquaintances, we
would be astonished, oftentimes, to see that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
assume an interest in ourselves which we have no
right to expect." People who are ill are likely
to make indiscriminate claims upon sympathy,
entertaining strangers as well as friends with detailed
descriptions of their latest symptoms, and
the doctor's latest remedies. Some of us who
have not the excuse of illness, impose on the persons
we meet by obliging them to listen to a great
deal of personal information which may be of
interest to ourselves, and possibly to those who
love us very dearly, but scarcely to any one else.</p>

<p>Several years ago the <i>Christian Union</i> related
this incident: The social occasion was a dinner.
One of the guests was a woman who had passed
middle life; good taste, ample means, with womanly
grace and natural refinement, made her an addition
to any circle. The hostess of the occasion
was a woman who prided herself on her ability to
meet the requirements of her station. She had no
doubt as to her fitness in any social capacity, but
her friends had not the same unquestioning faith
in her tact.</p>

<p>The gentle guest found to her delight that she
was assigned to the care of the son of an old school
friend, and inwardly thanked her hostess for the
consideration and thoughtfulness which made it
possible for her to hear from her friend, whom
she had not met in years. The guests were no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
sooner seated at the table than the hostess leaned
toward the young man, and, in a voice perfectly
audible to the entire company, said: "Never mind,
Bob, I will do better for you next time."</p>

<p>For one minute there was perfect silence, the
lady and her escort alike appalled by what had
been said; but the kindliness of the guest overcame
the embarrassing moment by calling the
attention of the young man to the roses on the
table, which, she said to him with a smile, were
great favorites of his mother when she was in
school. This broke the ice. The hostess was perfectly
unconscious that she had been guilty of
any rudeness. Her intention was to be particularly
polite to the young man; first to assure him
that he would be her guest again, and, secondly,
that she would then have a rosebud to assign to
his care. The amusing part was that the young
man greatly admired his mother's friend, and had
frequently been her guest on his visits to the
city.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine how a woman could
move in society to any extent and remain capable
of such a blunder, and yet we have all passed
through similar experiences at the hands of people
whose social experience should render such tactlessness
impossible. There comes to mind now an
imposing woman, who prided herself on the fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
that she always said just what she thought. At a
reception, she filled the room by her manner; it was
impossible to continue oblivious of her presence.</p>

<p>Bowing affably to her acquaintances, she sailed&mdash;for
women of this type do not walk&mdash;up to a modest
little lady whose health, she had heard, was declining,
and in a loud voice exclaimed: "What have
you been doing to yourself? You have aged fifteen
years since last I saw you!" Not unkind by
intention, she was but practising her system of saying
just what she thought, and she was constantly
urging upon her friends the propriety of this course;
but what an unbearable place our world would be
if we all followed this example of inane and inconsiderate
bluntness.</p>

<p>So the woman who is always finding in you resemblances
to some other person whom she has
met, creates many of the uncomfortable experiences
of social life, and when she thinks it interesting
to exploit the character of your prototype,
dwelling upon the mental and physical defects, she
becomes unbearable. Yet society has, as yet,
found no sure way to eliminate her.</p>

<p>Such infelicities are not the outcrop of unkindness
so much as of a certain ineptitude or lack of
<i>savoir faire</i>. Such people feel constrained to do
their share of the talking, but have not acquired
tactfulness in selecting the topic, nor alertness to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
avoid the pitfalls&mdash;both of which traits may by
sedulous self-training be acquired by any one in
whom, unhappily, they are not innate.</p>

<p>In one of these instances bad manners were the
natural expression of the woman, because her impulse
was selfish; for it is certainly true that a
person of truly unselfish nature will not offend by
making personal remarks. Manners are the expression
of the heart, and the man or woman who
lives mentally in kindly, thoughtful relations with
fellow men and women will refrain from expressing
the thought which might possibly give offence.
There is no mystery in social grace. It is remembering
other people in their several relations to us.
The woman who is a social success is not the one
who has for her purpose in life so much the desire
merely to please, but the one whose desire, rather,
is to make others happy. One is a polite purpose;
the other is a fine type of unselfishness that makes
impossible the utterance of unwelcome truths to
the chagrin of anyone encountered in the casual
personal contact that we term society.</p>

<p>Holmes gave us some good advice when he said:
"Don't flatter yourselves that friendship authorizes
you to say disagreeable things to your intimates.
On the contrary, the nearer you come into
relation with a person, the more necessary do tact

<h2>THE<br />
COMPLIMENT OF ATTENTION.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"Were we as eloquent as angels we should please
some people more by listening than by talking."</i></p>

<p><i>"A good listener is as needful to a witty talker
as steel to flint. It is the sharp contact of the
two which makes the sparks fly."</i></p>
</div>

<p>There are certain amenities attending social
intercourse with which we are all familiar, yet
we are constantly forgetting to put them into
practice. In no respect is this forgetfulness more
noticeable than in conversation, and especially in
connection with what may be called "the compliment
of attention."</p>

<p>If you despair of becoming a good talker you
can, at least, make yourself a good listener, and
that is something not to be despised. There are
apt to be more good talkers than good listeners,
and, although to say so may sound paradoxical, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
better you listen, the greater will be your reputation
as a conversationalist.</p>

<p>In the opinion of the cynical Rochefoucauld,
the reason why so few persons make themselves
agreeable in conversation, is because they are more
concerned about what they are themselves going
to say, than what others are saying to them.</p>

<p>If you have read "Nicholas Nickleby," you
remember Mrs. Nickleby tells how remarkable
Smike was as a converser. She entertained poor
Smike for several hours with a genealogical account
of her family, including biographical sketches,
while he sat looking at her and wondering what
it was all about, and whether she learned it from a
book or said it from her own head.</p>

<p>Said a writer in the <i>Chicago Herald</i>: "What is
there, indeed, more colloquial than an intelligent
countenance, eagerly intent upon one while telling
a story? What language can be compared to
the speaking blush or flashing eye of an earnest
listener? It was Desdemona, with greedy ear devouring
his discourse, who won Othello's heart.
He told his wondrous story, and she listened&mdash;that
only was the witchcraft he had used."</p>

<p>It is said of Sir Walter Scott that, although
one of the best talkers in the world, he was also
the best listener. With the same bland look he
would watch, throughout an entire evening, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
lips of his garrulous tormentor ignorantly discoursing
on Greek epigrams, or crassly dilating on the
intricacies of a parliamentary debate.</p>

<p>It was said of Madame R&eacute;camier that she listened
most winningly, and this was one secret of
her wonderful power to charm.</p>

<p>We have all heard the story of Madame de Sta&euml;l,
who, by a clever stratagem, was introduced to a
deaf mute at a party. She talked to him the
whole evening, and afterward declared that never
before had she met so intelligent a listener and so
fine a conversationalist.</p>

<p>Do you remember the story told by Sterne in
"The Sentimental Journey"?</p>

<p>He had been represented to a French lady as
a great wit and an engaging converser, and the
lady was impatient for an introduction that she
might hear him talk.</p>

<p>They met, and, writes Sterne: "I had not taken
my seat before I saw she did not care a sou whether
I had any wit or no. I was to be convinced that
she had. I call heaven to witness I never once
opened the door of my lips."</p>

<p>The lady afterward said she never in her life
had a more improving conversation with a man.</p>

<p>Many other instances might be mentioned derived
from both fact and fiction, to show how attentive
listening may enhance the delights of con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>versation,
and that one may sometimes gain a
reputation for conversational powers by exercising
one's ear instead of one's tongue.</p>

<p>"A frequent caller at my home," said a lady, "is
a capital story-teller, always instructive and pleasing;
but she is a poor listener. When my part of
the conversation comes in, her manner is depressing.
I feel embarrassed, my words become
tangled, my memory leaves me, and I hurry to close
my remarks, conscious of having made a weak
argument, although I had a point when I began.
My friend loses her easy manner when I speak,
becomes restless, and breaks in upon me before I
have fairly begun. Her unresponsive eyes tell me
as plainly of her superiority as though she had
written it in black and white."</p>

<p>Clergymen, teachers, and public speakers understand
and appreciate better than others "the compliment
of attention." Embarrassing, indeed, is
it to anyone who is talking to observe signs of
weariness and inattention on the part of one's
hearers. Those not accustomed to stand before an
audience seldom realize that a speaker feels and
understands, without conscious endeavor, the attitude
toward him of every member of his audience.
The good listener inspires and encourages him,
while the restless, inattentive auditor is a thorn in
the flesh, irritating and distracting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>At the close of a lecture given a few years ago
in a town in Maine, the lecturer&mdash;who was a state
superintendent of schools&mdash;turned to the writer
and asked:</p>

<p>"Who are those two ladies dressed in black,
standing there by the window?"</p>

<p>After telling him their names the writer said,
"Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>The lecturer replied: "They have been of great
help to me all the evening. They are delightful
listeners. They appeared to appreciate so thoroughly
everything I said that I seemed to be talking
especially for their benefit."</p>

<p>"That girl," said a teacher, pointing to an attractive
young lady just leaving the school-room,
"is the most restful pupil I ever had
in my school. She is so gentle in her demeanor,
so thoughtful and so attentive during recitations,
that one cannot help loving her. No matter how
restless the other members of the school become,
she is always giving the closest attention. If one
could have an entire school like her, teaching would
be a delight; but she is one among fifty."</p>

<p>We gain many things besides the good will of
others, by being good listeners, even though we
must sometimes submit to be bored to an unlimited
degree without interrupting the speaker, or responding
in any other way than by "nods and
becks and wreath&eacute;d smiles."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Open your mouth and shut your eyes and see
what heaven will send you," says the old maxim;
but, "shut your mouth and open your eyes," has
been suggested as much more sensible advice under
some circumstances.</p>

<p>"But," you say, "we are told that Samuel Johnson,
Tennyson and Macaulay, and many other
great thinkers, usually monopolized the conversation
when they were in company, and their friends
delighted to listen to them. Surely they gave but
little heed to 'the compliment of attention.'" Very
true, but no doubt they would have been sometimes
more agreeable to the company if they had
been more considerate of the wishes of other people.
Great men are great in spite of their weaknesses,
not because of them. We can forgive unpleasant
propensities in a genius more easily than in the
average mortal, and as almost all of us are average
mortals, without a trace of anything akin to
genius, we cannot afford to dispense with any of
those qualities which help to make us pleasing to
others. We should remember that there was but
one Macaulay&mdash;a man who could talk brilliantly
on almost all subjects&mdash;and notwithstanding his
brilliancy, his friends admitted that he was often
something of a bore.</p>

<p>A very useful lesson may be learned from a
little story which appeared some years ago in
<i>The Youth's Companion</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>George Paul, a young civil engineer, while
surveying a railway in the Pennsylvania hills, met
a plain, lovable little country girl, and married
her. After a few weeks he brought her home to
his family in New York, and left her there while
he returned to camp.</p>

<p>Marian had laid many plans to win the affections
of her new kinsfolk. She had practiced
diligently at her music; she was sure they would
be pleased to hear her stories of her beautiful sister
and her brother; she imagined their admiration
of her new blue silk gown and winter bonnet.
But the Pauls, one and all, were indifferent to her
music, her family and her gowns. They gave
"George's wife" a friendly welcome, and then each
went on his or her way, and paid no more attention
to her.</p>

<p>After the first shock of disappointment Marian
summoned her courage.</p>

<p>"If I have nothing to give them, they have
much to give me," she thought, cheerfully. She
listened eagerly when Isabel sung, and her smiles
and tears showed how keenly she appreciated the
music. She examined Louisa's paintings every
day with unflagging interest, discussed every
effect, and was happy if she could help mix the
colors or prepare the canvas. She questioned
grandma about her neuralgia, advised new rem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>edies,
or listened unwearied to the account of old
ones day after day. When Uncle John, just returned
from Japan, began to describe his adventures,
Marian was the only auditor who never grew
tired nor interrupted him.</p>

<p>After a two hours' lecture, in which her part
had been that of a dumb, bright-faced listener,
Uncle John declared that George's wife was the
most intelligent woman he had ever met.</p>

<p>When George came home the whole family was
loud in her praises. She was a fine musician;
she had unerring taste in art; she was charming,
witty and lovable. But George soon saw that she
had won them unconsciously&mdash;not by displaying
her own merits, but by appreciating theirs.</p>

<p>This is a true story in fact, but the truth of its
meaning is repeated wherever a woman is found
who has that quality called charm. She may be
plain or even deformed, but she will win friendship
and love.</p>

<p>Many an attractive girl would save herself much
anxiety and vain effort on her entrance into the
world of society, if she understood that society, so
called, is composed of individuals, the most of
whom desire not to find the beauty, the wit, the
talent of others, but to elicit the cordial recognition
by others, of their own.</p>

<h2>THE VOICE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"Tender tones prevent severe truths from offending."</i></p>

<p><i>"There are tones which set commonplace words
apart, and give them lights and deeps of meaning,
just as one fine emotion idealizes and exalts
a homely face."</i></p>

<p><i>"There is no power of love so effective as a
kind voice. A kind hand is deaf and dumb. It
may be rough in flesh and blood, yet do the work
of a soft heart, and do it with a soft touch. But
there is no one thing that love so much needs as
a sweet voice to tell what it means and feels."</i></p>
</div>

<p>In our efforts to please, while much depends
upon what we say, quite as much depends upon how
we say it. The influence of a pleasing voice is
wonderful; who has not felt its charm?</p>

<p>It has been said that the greatest defect in the
American woman is her voice, and while this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
may not be strictly true, there are heard in conversation
at home and abroad many voices more
unpleasant than necessary&mdash;more harsh, more
rasping.</p>

<p>A woman's voice may imply good breeding, or
the reverse, and in estimating the power of feminine
charms, a pleasing voice should be placed
very near the head of the list. Is it not strange,
then, that so little effort is made to remedy defects
in vocal expression?</p>

<p>We cultivate the voice for singing and for elocutionary
effects, but little is done for the average
boy or girl by way of training the voice for the
everyday effect. Only a few can sing well enough
to give pleasure to others, but we all talk every
day of our lives, and often the quality of our voice
speaks more significantly than the words we utter.
A sympathetic tone will often win us a friend,
though what we say may be of little importance.
Purity of accent plays a great part in the art
of charming, and it has been truly said that "a
woman may be ugly, old, without distinction or
instruction, but if she have a soft, insinuating,
mellow-toned voice, she will charm as much as her
more beautiful sister."</p>

<p>A telephone operator in a place near New York
was on a certain Christmas the recipient of checks
for five, ten and a hundred dollars, a diamond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
pin, a dress pattern, and eight boxes of confectionery;
although she was known to the donors
only by her gentle voice, by the deference of its
tone, by her readiness to accommodate, and by her
office number as one of the operators.</p>

<p>Why is it that we regard vocal training and oral
expression as something to be confined wholly to
the specialists? We think such training is needed
by public speakers and readers, and by all who
intend to make a professional use of the voice, but
we do not appreciate its value for the average man
or woman.</p>

<p>"What should we think," says <i>Expression</i>, "of
a woman who dresses in the richest of apparel,
who is extremely careful of every point of dress,
but who speaks with a nasal twang and throaty
tone, and makes no effort to correct the fault?
We know that this is often the case. Why is not
the inconsistency corrected? Why is there no
endeavor to improve the voice and make it beautiful
and winning? What a sensitiveness people
exhibit about going abroad with a smudge on the
face; but, alas! there is little sensitiveness regarding
a smudge on one's voice.</p>

<p>The truth is that voice culture should not be
confined to the few, but should become a prescribed
branch of the education of boys and girls generally.
Not alone are the voices of the women too often un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>melodious,
but those of the men also need attention.
A fine voice may be of inestimable value to a man.
The majority of the celebrated orators have been
aided by the possession of a good voice, along with
the knowledge requisite to enable them to employ
it effectively. Mr. Lecky says that O'Connell's
voice, rising with a melodiously modulated swell,
filled the largest auditoriums and triumphed over
the wildest tumult, while at the same time it conveyed
every shade of feeling with the most delicate
flexibility.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone's voice is said to have had the
musical quality and the resonance of a silver trumpet;
while William Pitt, who was a ruler in Parliament
at the age of twenty-one, possessed a voice of
masterful power yet of a wonderful sweetness.</p>

<p>Webster's voice, on the occasion of his reply to
Senator Dickinson, was so commanding, so forceful,
that one of his listeners said he felt all the
night as if a heavy cannonade had been resounding
in his ears.</p>

<p>Garrick used to say that he would give one hundred
guineas if he could say "Oh" as Whitefield
would say it.</p>

<p>"But," you declare, "nature has not given us
voices like the voices of those celebrated men, and
we must be content with what we have."</p>

<p>While nature may not have bestowed upon us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
their melodious voices, we can do much to improve
our own. A study of biography will inform us
that many of the most successful speakers, whether
actors or orators, have been men and women
possessing some native defect of speech or figure
which they resolutely mastered by patient, persevering
application. We all know of Demosthenes'
impediment of speech, and are familiar with
the story of his months of struggle and his final
success.</p>

<p>Savonarola, when he first spoke in the cathedral
at Florence, was considered a failure, on account
of his wretched voice and awkward manner.
Phillips Brooks, one of the greatest preachers
America has produced, was told by his college
president that the ministry was out of the question
for him because of his nervousness and the
defects of his speech.</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply instances to show
that the most awkward body and the roughest
voice may be brought under control. In fact,
where the voice is imperfect and the man is
obliged to make a determined effort to master it,
he attains by this means, a mental vigor and an
emotional strength and a flexibility of voice and
mind, as well as a command over the body, which
render his delivery in the highest degree effective.</p>

<p>Again, it is not sufficient that we have nat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>urally
a melodious voice; we must know how, or else
learn how, to use it. There must be feeling and expression
in one's tones. If we wish to express cordiality,
words are futile unless the voice sounds the
feeling we wish to express. We need to learn how
to modulate the voice so as to make it a true
reflex of the mind and mood. Unless it tells of
sincerity, apologies fail to convince of a contrite
spirit. Unless it conveys confidence, protestations
are in vain; yet the very tone of one's
voice may allay bitterness, though one may
stumble over the words of an apology. If, then,
one recognizes the fact that his voice is colorless
and devoid of feeling, though his heart be warm,
let him at once apply himself to remedying the
defect.</p>

<p>Listen to your own voice when speaking, and
note the harsh, strident tones, and the imperfect
inflection, and correct them. Many girls speak
in a nervous, jerky, rapid way, beginning a sentence
and repeating a portion of it two or three
times before completing it. Some speak in high,
shrill tones which are not only displeasing but
positively irritating because discordant. Some
speak too fast, while others, going to the opposite
extreme, simply drawl. These are defects which
can be corrected, and, by correcting them we add
measurably to our power to charm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>If you do not understand the imperfections of
your tone productions, or the faults in your manner
of speaking, or if you have trouble in correcting
them, go to one who does know, and who
is as sensitive to the speaking voice as he is to
the singing voice. It may cost you something to
do this, but it will be money judiciously expended.
You take music lessons, both vocal and
instrumental, and you do not consider the money
expended for such lessons as wasted even though
you have no intention of going upon the stage in
opera or of becoming a professional pianist. You
study music as an accomplishment. Why then
should you not give some time, and if need be, a
little money for the purpose of perfecting your
speaking voice, if by so doing you can make yourself
more agreeable to others. You may not be
called upon very often to sing or play for other
people, but you will talk every day and many times
each day, and the voice is "the agent of the soul's
expression."</p>

<p>"The art of singing," says <i>The Boston Herald</i>,
"strange to say, does not include the art of speaking,
for some very fine singers have harsh and
unmusical voices in conversation. But with all
the training now given to the rising generation,
voice education should be considered. Take the
rasp and the hardness out of your sons' and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
daughters' speech, and give them another grace
with which to conquer society."</p>

<p>The importance of what we say and how we
say it, has never been more clearly or pointedly
expressed than in this quotation from an American
writer: "A man may look like a monkey and yet
turn out to be a philosopher; a man may dress
like a vagabond, and yet have the intuitions of
a scholar and a gentleman. The face, the expression
of the eye, the dress, the manner even,
may all be deceptive, but the voice and speech of
men and women classify them infallibly."</p>

<h2>GOOD MANNERS.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Life is not so short but that there is always
time for courtesy.</i></p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Emerson.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>"Politeness is real kindness kindly expressed.
This is the sum and substance of all true politeness.
Put it in practice and all will be charmed
with your manner."</i></p>

<p><i>Young men generally would doubtless be thoroughly
astonished if they could comprehend at
a single glance how greatly their personal happiness,
popularity, prosperity, and usefulness depend
on their manners.</i></p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">J. G. Holland.</span><br />
</p>
</div>


<p>In attracting others to us the value of a pleasing
manner cannot be estimated. It is like sunshine.
We feel it at once, and we are attracted
to the person who possesses it.</p>

<p>"Give a boy address and accomplishments,"
said Emerson, "and you give him the mastery of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
palaces and fortunes wherever he goes; he has
not the trouble of earning or owning them: they
solicit him to enter and possess."</p>

<p>Much has been written upon this subject. Indeed,
so much has been said, and said so well,
that there will be little attempt to do anything
else in this chapter than to bring together some
of the best thoughts of the best authors.</p>

<p>The men and women who have accomplished
great things in the world have, as a rule, understood
the value of politeness, and have acted in
accordance with that knowledge. You can, possibly,
recall a very few exceptions, but these were
persons great in spite of their lack of courtesy,
and they would have been even greater had they
practiced the art of gentle manners.</p>

<p>The Duke of Marlborough, whose general education
was in some respects sadly neglected, had
so irresistible a charm of manner that he swayed
the destinies of nations. Mirabeau, who was
unattractive in person, won by his politeness the
good will of all with whom he came in contact.
There has been no time in the history of the
world when good manners counted for more than
they do at the present time. In fact, to-day more
than ever before a man is dependent for success
upon his personality. Good manners often
bring to one many things that wealth cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
procure, and "politeness has won more victories
than powder."</p>

<p>"No one," says an American writer, "who has
any appreciation of grace and beauty in nature or
in art can fail to recognize the charm of fine manners
in an individual. We rejoice in them as we
do in a lovely sunset view, or a beautiful piece of
architecture, or a fascinating poem, for their own
sake and for what they express; but even beyond
this they have another attraction in the magnetic
power they exert upon all beholders in setting them
at ease, in sweeping away shyness, awkwardness
and restraint, and in stimulating them to the expression
of whatever is best worth cherishing within
them."</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true that the presence of fine
manners, whether it be in the home or the social
circle, in the workshop or the counting-room, in
the visit of charity or the halls of legislation, has
an immediate effect in reproducing itself, in diffusing
happiness, in developing the faculties, and in
eliciting the best that is in everybody.</p>

<p>Surely there is no quality that a girl or a
woman can possess which recommends her more
favorably to the good opinion of others than that
of uniform courtesy and good manners.</p>

<p>William Wirt's letter to his daughter on the
"small, sweet courtesies of life," contains a pas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>sage
from which a deal of happiness may be
learned. "I want to tell you a secret. The way
to make yourself pleasant to others is to show them
attention. The whole world is like the miller at
Mansfield, who cared for nobody&mdash;no not he, because
nobody cared for him. And the whole world
would serve you so, if you gave them the same
cause. Let everyone, therefore, see that you do
care for them by showing them the small courtesies
in which there is no parade, whose voice is still to
please; and which manifest themselves by tender
and affectionate looks, and little acts of attention,
giving others the preference in every little enjoyment
at the table, walking, sitting, or standing."</p>

<p>Young men who wish to make their way in the
world cannot afford to forget that there is not
in all the world a talisman of such potent magic
as the irresistible spell of a charming manner.
While in some cases it seems innate, it can, in a
great measure, be acquired. Yet a careful observer
of the young men of the present generation cannot
fail to notice a tendency, on the part of some
at least, to disregard the small courtesies of life&mdash;the
intangible, yet very perceptible little things
which make the man a gentleman. Some people
even contend that outward manner is a secondary
consideration if the head is well stored with knowl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>edge,
and that if a young man has the faculty to
get on in the world, it is a matter of very little
importance if he have not the manners of a Chesterfield.
That this idea is prevalent is accounted for
by the great number of well-educated men&mdash;men of
ability and power&mdash;who, clever and with no lack
of brains, are painfully deficient in good breeding.
With no intentional lapses they are awkward,
presuming, and even vulgar.</p>

<p>"In most countries," says the <i>Toronto Week</i>,
"an educated man and a gentleman are almost
synonymous terms. On this side of the Atlantic
they by no means always apply to the same man.
Educational advantages are within the reach of
all classes of people&mdash;even persons who have missed
the benefit of home training for their manners,
or who have not numbered cultured persons among
their acquaintances. Such persons by native
ability and hard work often attain to high positions
of honor and trust in the various professions,
and win for themselves the title of 'self-made.'</p>

<p>"Yet because a man by his brains, energy, and
pluck carves out his own fortune, putting himself
in a prominent position, is it not very desirable
that he should also cultivate the courtesies of life
so that the talent be not hidden by roughness and
uncultivated bearing."</p>

<p>We frequently meet college students&mdash;especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
from the smaller colleges&mdash;good, honest, earnest,
ambitious fellows, who are working hard to make
their way in the world. They are poor, and have
come from homes where the stern realities of
gaining a livelihood have left, apparently, no time
for culture; where the table manners are but little
better than those of the logging camp, and where
the graces of refined speech and manners have
never even taken root. They may take never so
high a rank in their college studies, may pursue
the work preparatory to a profession with never so
much diligence, yet they will always be handicapped
by their ignorance of those embellishments
so necessary to social, and even business, success.
They find themselves continually placed at a disadvantage,
and their lack of social training is responsible
for failures which might have been
avoided.</p>

<p>Because a man is a successful lawyer he is not
justified in saying that he can be his own tailor,
or that ill-fitting clothes, if belonging to him and
of his own make, are as suitable as those of a good
cut. So it is with the intellectual giant who takes
no heed of his manners. He may learn much
from less talented persons, who are, nevertheless,
his superiors in many respects. Desirable as it
may be for a young man to shun the extravagance
of the &aelig;sthete, and to despise the shams of society,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
he cannot afford to neglect the courtesies of life;
and he does well who, while devoting his energies
to mathematics and the classics, pays attention to
the improvement of his manners. It is while
young that manners are formed; the most strenuous
efforts will not wholly eradicate in after life
the awkward habits formed in youth.</p>

<p>The young man who is ambitious, upon whom
Dame Fortune is already turning a dawning smile,
should pause and think about this matter. Some
time he may be rich; some time he may aspire to a
high position in society or in public life, and he
should begin early to fit himself for the proud
position he means to occupy.</p>

<p>The outward address of a man has no little influence
upon his success in business. The polite
attention and readiness to meet every reasonable,
and often unreasonable, demand of his customers,
on the part of A. T. Stewart, when he opened his
narrow linen store on Broadway, was almost as
important a factor in his rapid success in securing
business as his remarkable quickness in discovering
changes in the market, and in adapting his goods
to the taste and necessities of his patrons. This
marked self-restraint and politeness of manner he
retained to the last.</p>

<p>It is strange that every business man does not
appreciate the commercial value of politeness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
The writer knows a clerk who is employed in a
drug store in one of the largest towns of Maine.
So polite is he in his attentions to customers, so
willing to be helpful, so pleasing in his manner,
with that restraint and quietness which mark the
gentleman and destroy every trace of effusion, that
he has made himself invaluable to his employer.
It is reported that, more than once, his friends
have urged him to establish a business of his own,
but his employer, realizing his value in attracting
and holding customers, has turned him from the
idea by a generous increase of salary. Thousands
of clerks and thousands of professional and business
men could greatly increase their earning
power by closer attention to the accepted rules of
courtesy.</p>

<p>Some people excuse a roughness of manner by
saying that they detest affectations of all kinds,
that they love the truth, that they are perfectly
frank and outspoken. Such people pride themselves
upon their naturalness, and on the ground
of frankness they will wound by rude language,
will insult you, and defend their awkwardness and
ill-breeding by the plea of "natural manners."
Naturalness is not always commendable. If nature
has not invested us with those qualities which
are pleasing to others, we should try to improve
upon nature. The plainest truths may be conveyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
in civil speech, and it is better to "assume a virtue
if you have it not." To object to politeness on the
ground that its language is sometimes unmeaning
and expressed for effect, is as foolish as it would be
to object to the decoration of our parlors or the
wearing of good clothes.</p>

<p>In the ordinary compliments of good society
there is no intention to deceive. Polite language
is pleasant to the ear, and soothing to the heart,
while rough words are the reverse, and while they
may not always be the result of bad temper, they
are quite likely to cause it.</p>

<p>The motive for politeness should not be the desire
to shine, or to raise one's self into society supposed
to be better than one's own. The cultivation
of good manners is not merely a means to the
gratification of personal vanity, but it is a duty
we owe not only to other people but to ourselves; a
duty to make ourselves better in every respect than
we are. Indeed, the true spirit of good manners is
so nearly allied to that of good morals that they
seem almost inseparable.</p>

<p>"Did you ever think how invisible is the armor
of defence afforded by perfect politeness?" asks
<i>Harper's Bazar</i>. "Neither man, woman nor child
can resist it. The quick tempered Irish maid who
loses her hold on her tongue so easily and 'answers
back' with a hot retort is abashed when her mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>tress
meets her with quiet courtesy. The angry
person, off guard and saying what he really does
not mean, is foiled by the self-control of his interlocutor,
who has not, for an instant, forgotten the
gracious manner of good breeding."</p>

<p>Politeness is, perhaps, instinctive with some, but
with the majority it is a matter of training, of the
slow and careful discipline of voice and eye and
carriage. Under this training all the angles of
personal vanity and self-consciousness are rubbed
off, the person becomes adorned with grace, ease,
simplicity and gentleness, and what may seem to
the untrained observer as the perfection of naturalness
may be simply the perfection of culture.</p>

<p>Very sensitive persons who suffer acutely from
fancied slights can save themselves many wounds
by always being as scrupulous in giving as they
are in exacting courtesy. To suffer one's self to
perpetrate a rudeness is to lay one's self open to
the same. In nothing should we be less economical
than in politeness. It should lead us to prompt
and generous acknowledgment of every kindness,
to responsive thanks when a gift, however small,
is brought to our door. It should oblige us to
listen with patient attention even to the person
whose conversation is not entertaining, to sit apparently
absorbed when in public we are present
at concert or lecture. This defensive armor, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
smooth, so polished, so easily worn, will make our
intercourse with society agreeable.</p>

<p>The fact is, that when we come in contact with
human beings anywhere and in any occupation,
we are quite likely to get in return just what we
give.</p>

<p>A man who is always the gentleman seldom
meets with rebuffs from even the most unpolished
and crude. The employer who uses kind words
with his workmen, usually gets kind words in
return.</p>

<span class="smcap">J. G. Holland.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>As the author of this volume is a man, this
chapter on dress is, of course, written from a man's
point of view. He knows very well that, were he
to attempt to write scientifically of woman's clothes
he would be lost. No one but a woman can do
that. The man who tried it would soon find himself
bewildered by a maze of technical terms and
expressions which seem absolutely necessary to describe
exactly what is meant. Possibly, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the author can take a broad, mental grasp of the
subject apart from and above the pretty finesse
with which feminine writers would treat the subject.
Clothes are the woman's weapons, one of the
resources of civilization, with which woman
marches forth to the conquest of the masculine
world, and the writer wishes to estimate from the
man's standpoint just how much the silks, the
laces, the ribbons and the velvets have to do in influencing
the masculine heart.</p>

<p>What one wears is accepted as an index of one's
character. Whether this is as it should be or not,
yet it is true; and we all feel, more or less, that
coarseness or refinement finds visible expression in
apparel as in no other way. "Surely," says <i>The
Boston Journal</i>, "nothing so intensifies the personality
as the clothes one wears; through association
they become a part of us, help to identify us, even
in some peculiar, reactionary way, serve to control
our mental states."</p>

<p>Many women will tell you that their most infallible
cure for weariness and the blues is to go
and dress up in one of their prettiest gowns.
Many men will tell you that a clean shave, clean
linen, and a fresh suit of clothes are most reviving
and soothing in their effect upon the psychical as
well as the physical man.</p>

<p>The statement, often made, that women dress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
well only to please the men, is only a fraction
of the truth.</p>

<p>They dress to please the men; to please one another,
and to please themselves. Which of these
three motives is the strongest depends upon the
individual, for,&mdash;"while there are men and men,
there are women and women and women," and it
is absurd to make any attempt to analyze motives
or to formulate principles which will apply to all
women.</p>

<p>The men who dress well do it for the women
and for themselves. The effect that their apparel
has upon others of their own sex, gives men but
little concern. If all the women should be taken
from the world tailors would at once lose half their
business, for the men would immediately begin to
wear out their old clothes.</p>

<p>As a rule, few men care very much for fine
clothes for their own sake, but a love of dress
is natural in woman, and one who exhibits indifference
in regard to her personal appearance
convicts herself of either indolence, self-righteousness
or pedantry. A woman who has not
some natural taste in dress, who does not take
a positive delight in combinations of colors, who
is not fond of fine apparel for its own sake, is an
anomaly.</p>

<p>Men do not notice details of a woman's dress.
Few know enough about the subject to distinguish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
cheese-cloth from <i>point d'esprit</i>. The description
in detail of a new gown as given in a fashion
journal is about as intelligible to the average man
as the inscriptions on an Assyrian tablet.</p>

<p>They accept the woman as a whole, and consider
her, and what she has on, as one harmonious, homogeneous,
unanalyzable completeness. If you
doubt this ask a man to tell you how a certain lady
was dressed at a reception he attended the evening
before. Perhaps he noticed her particularly while
there, and told you at the time that she was becomingly
attired. He may be able to tell you that
she wore a pink waist, or that the prevailing color
of her costume was blue, but there his knowledge of
the subject ends.</p>

<p>While it is true that men give but little thought
to the details of a woman's dress, unless it is conspicuously
bad, very many of them know whether
she is becomingly attired or not. While they may
have no clear idea as to whether the material of a
gown cost five cents or five dollars a yard, or
whether the gown itself is quite in fashion, they
know whether the owner carries it well, and
whether the material, style and color are becoming
to her. Perhaps, on the whole, a man of good
taste is a better judge than a woman as to whether
she is becomingly dressed. This is because they
regard the subject from entirely different stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>points.
The stylishly gowned woman is, to the
average woman, well dressed, but not necessarily
so to the man. It is a perpetual wonder to some
men why women have not the courage to reject certain
combinations and certain styles of dress that
are inharmonious and ugly in themselves, and,
consequently, unbecoming to the one who wears
them.</p>

<p>Years ago certain colors were thought to be becoming
to certain types of women. There was an
undisputed tradition in regard to the colors which
the blonde should wear, and also what ones were
becoming to the brunette. This was not a dictate
of fashion; it was a fact ascertained by experience.
Of late these traditions have been disregarded by
fashion, and the stylish woman wears any color
or combination she pleases, but often at the sacrifice
of her good looks.</p>

<p>Fashion cannot change the laws of cause and
effect&mdash;the laws of harmony&mdash;and if the decided
brunette chooses to wear colors which are becoming
only to blondes she does it at the expense of
half her natural beauty. Men feel this and wonder
what is amiss.</p>

<p>A few years ago fashion made quite common a
style of sailor hat with diminutive crown made
in the shape of an hour-glass. They were ugly
in themselves, and when perched upon the head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
detracted from the beauty of any face. Nothing
could be more ridiculous than the sight of a stout,
tall girl, with broad hips and prominent features,
marching along the street with her head surmounted
by that parody on the most becoming of
all hats for a young woman&mdash;the sailor. One at
once called to mind the dice-box which the negro
minstrel wears to make himself appear as funny
as possible. One man wittily characterized them
as "the hats that wore corsets." Men never liked
them, but thousands of them were worn.</p>

<p>From a man's point of view it would be far
better if women made a more comprehensive and
sensible study of their individual needs in dress
and did not blindly follow the decrees of fashion;
if more women would realize that the garment
suitable to a tall, slim figure, is utterly inappropriate
to a stout, short one. When Sara Bernhardt
invented the glove which was to give size and form
to her thin and poorly shaped arm, she recognized
the highest aim of fashion. When a woman is in
need of a new hat or bonnet, a man's advice would
be: "Hunt the tables until you find one which, in
shape and trimming, is suitable and becoming to
you. Never mind if it is not the very latest style;
if it suits your face and figure, take it, and you
will not be sorry."</p>

<p>In furnishing a room we understand that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
we should put in it only what makes the
room look better&mdash;not what is simply pretty
in itself; and if women would follow a similar
plan in dress,&mdash;wear only what is becoming to them,
and not wear things, simply because they think
them pretty and fashionable, men would be better
pleased. Man is attracted by a woman's beauty
itself, and whether she has just the latest modes
or not seldom interests him in the least. So the
girl who would dress to please men, should, first
of all, wear what will show off her natural attractiveness
of face and figure to the best advantage;
after that she may be as fashionable as possible.</p>

<p>Without doubt many girls attach too much importance
to dress as a means of attracting the
other sex. It is frequently the case that, when
a young lady is invited to a social function, her
first thought is, "What shall I wear?" Her
second thought is, "What shall I wear?" This
question is with her much of the time until she
goes to the place where she is to be entertained;
and as she enters the room her first thought is,
"I wonder how I look." If, upon an examination
of the other young ladies present, she concludes that
she is as well dressed as anyone there, she experiences
a feeling of restfulness and of satisfaction,
and enjoys the evening. She imagines she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
must be an object of interest to the men, and to
an extent she is.</p>

<p>Men like women to be "well groomed." They
take in her whole appearance at a glance, and
then pay but little further attention to the question
of gowns, ribbons, slippers or sashes. They
want to be entertained and amused. If the only
preparation a young lady has made to render
herself attractive and interesting is the care bestowed
upon her personal appearance; if her resources
for attracting consist only of a pretty face
and a graceful figure in a pretty gown, she will
never become famous for her conquests.</p>

<p>Simplicity and exquisitely fresh neatness and
daintiness are to a man more attractive than any
extravagance of fashion or costliness of material.
No man was ever induced to propose to a girl by
the splendor of her costume. Of course it would
be absurd to assert that physical beauty is of no
value, or that dress is of little importance. That
girl who is born physically beautiful, is fortunate
indeed, and any girl of common sense knows that
an attractive gown or a becoming hat is of importance.
The great thing for her to understand
is that there must be something better under the
becoming hat than a pretty face, for her own
happiness, and if she would be very attractive
to others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as there are some persons who are said
to be born magnetic, so some women are supposed
to have a peculiarly attractive way of wearing
clothes which defies imitation.</p>

<p>Said a writer in the <i>Springfield Republican</i>:
"There is a subtle something which one cannot
get on the microscopic slide, which refuses to be
reduced to percentages, which baffles description,
and that is the manner in which some women wear
their clothes. Two girls with faces of equal value
and garments of identical texture will fail to produce
equivalent effects, because one has this indefinable
quality, and the other has not. Consequently
we often hear it said that some girls are
more attractive in calico than others in richer
material."</p>

<p>That there is a marked difference in the way
different women wear their clothes, no one will
deny, but because some girls look and appear to
better advantage than others in the same material,
is it necessary to regard it as beyond comprehension,
or to declare that it "baffles description"?
The writer did not go far enough in his
description of the two girls. While their faces
were of equal value, and their clothing was of the
same material, there might be other differences
which would account for the "indefinable quality."
Possibly one was pleasing in manner and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
other not. One was awkward in person and in
speech, while the other was tactful and graceful.
One was dull; the other interesting. The difference
was one of physical and mental characteristics,
and not a quality that "baffles description."
Indeed it is a difference easily understood and
analyzed.</p>

<p>If two girls have faces and forms of equal value,
and are equally graceful, tactful and well mannered,
their clothes, if of the same form and material,
will be worn in much the same way, and
will produce much the same effect.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>No man, whatever his position in the world
may be, can afford to be careless about his personal
appearance. Dress may not make the man,
but we all form in our minds a very clear idea of
what a man is by his dress. We gain our first
impression of persons by what they have on; our
second judgment is formed from their conversation
and manner.</p>

<p>The well dressed man is more attractive to
others, and he feels much better himself than he
would if carelessly attired. Have you noticed the
wonderful transformation which takes place in a
man when he doffs his everyday clothes and dons
a dress suit? During the day he may have an
untidy and even a slovenly appearance, but as soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
as he puts on a well laundered shirt, a high standing
collar, a fresh lawn tie, and a dress suit, he
seems completely changed. He looks from five
to ten years younger, and from his manner you
know that he feels younger. He is on better terms
with himself and with the world.</p>

<p>Every woman likes a man better for being well
dressed. She may excuse, or overlook, carelessness
or even slovenliness in his personal appearance,
if she is very fond of him, but she would like
him much more if he were neat and tidy and tasteful.
She may forgive his green and yellow necktie,
she may overlook his soiled linen, she may
make no reference to his coat with its collar
covered with dust and dandruff; she may not let
him know that she has even noticed any of these
things, but she has. She thinks of them whenever
he is with her, and sometimes when she is away
from him, and she wishes he were different. She
may like him in spite of these defects. Women
usually like a man in spite of things. If a man
noticed half as many things about a woman that
did not please him, he would never love her at all.</p>

<p>Leaving out of the question the fact that women
like to have men neat and even elegant in their
raiment, no man who is seeking to make his way
in business or in a profession, can afford to be
careless about his clothes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"A few men," says <i>The Lewiston Journal</i>,
"clothed in the serenity of soul that approaches
the insanity of genius can afford to go illy-clothed.
President Lincoln was given free license to wear
frock coats unbecomingly. Horace Greeley could
wear a linen duster with grace and equanimity.
But they were unique. They could make fashion
look insignificant, but you and I cannot, if we
care to move amid the throng of busy people seeking
passage on the car of progress."</p>

<p>No better advice has been given to men on the
subject of dress than in an article which appeared
in <i>Success</i>. A short extract from the article will
close this chapter.</p>

<p>"Clothes are one of the accepted standards by
which men are judged the world over. They form
the chief standard of first impression; so, for that
reason alone, it would be difficult to overestimate
their importance. They show at a glance whether
a man is neat or untidy; careful or careless;
methodical or shiftless, and what sort of taste he
has. Nothing else about him reflects so much of
his personal characteristics. So it is not surprising
to be told by those who yearly give employment
to thousands of men and boys, that more
applicants are turned away on account of their
personal appearance than for all other reasons
put together. But it would surprise some people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
very much if they knew how widely this rule is
applied.</p>

<p>The well dressed man is one whose clothes do
not make him the object of comment, either because
they are showy or shabby. He never goes
to the extremes of fashion, thereby courting
notoriety; he never goes to the other extreme by
paying no attention at all to what he wears or
how he wears it. He is always modest in his attire.
He conforms to the established customs of
changing his attire as the occasion demands, without
making himself a slave to reform. He does
not always wear expensive clothes, nor is it at all
necessary that he should. But he is always clean
and neat, or, as the present day has it, he is "well
groomed."</p>

<h2>THE OPTIMIST.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>The habit of looking on the bright side of things
is worth far more than a thousand pounds a year.</i></p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">&mdash;Samuel Johnson.</span><br />
</p>

<p><i>"More than half the unhappiness in the world
comes from a person's unwillingness to look on
the bright side so long as a dark side can be discovered."</i></p>
</div>

<p>We all like the optimist. The bright, cheerful,
good-natured fellow, who always looks through
the cloud and sees its silver lining, is as good as
a tonic to our most pessimistic dispositions. If,
then, you wish to make yourself agreeable to others
and to yourself, cultivate the habit of cheerfulness&mdash;of
always looking on the bright side. Wear a
pleasant countenance; let cheerfulness beam in
your eye; let love write its mark on your forehead,
and have kind words and a pleasant greeting
for those whom you meet. Don't forget to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
say "good morning!" and say it heartily. Say
it to your brothers and sisters, your school-mates,
your parents, your teachers and your friends.
Pleasant, hearty greetings cheer the discouraged,
rest the tired, and make the wheels of life run
more smoothly. They clear up the thorny pathways,
win friends, and confound enemies. In fact,
it is impossible to resist the influence of cheerfulness.
Let a bright face beam on the darkness
of defeat, shine on the abode of poverty; illumine
the chamber of sickness, and how everything
changes under its benign influence.</p>

<p>Victory becomes possible, competence promises a
golden future, and health is wooed back again.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you cannot estimate the
amount of unhappiness you may cause by wearing
a clouded face and by speaking harsh, unkind
words.</p>

<p>Many persons fret and whine all through life.
They never appear to have a generous impulse.</p>

<p>"They seem to have come into the world during
one of those cold, bleak, gloomy days, when there
was nothing with which to build a fire. They,
apparently, grew up in the same bleak atmosphere,
and they live in it all their lives. You
see their smallness in everything they do and say.
You see it in their buying and in their selling, in
their talk and in their actions. They have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
well called 'the frogs that constitute one of the
plagues of society.' They have never made one
heart glad, nor shed one ray of sunshine upon
man, woman, or child."</p>

<p>It is just as easy to be kind as to be cross,
and as easy to give pleasure as pain. It costs
nothing; it is a smile, an appreciative word, a
mention of what one likes to hear spoken of rather
than an irritating reference.</p>

<p>If your minister has preached a sermon that
interested and helped you, tell him so. It will
encourage and cheer him, and he will try to give
you still better sermons in the future. Remember
that the preacher is much more human than most
people think, and that no man more highly prizes
the genuine, manly word of good cheer, sympathy
and affection. If your grocer has sold you something
that was particularly good, tell him so. No
doubt you have often found fault with the tea
and the flour and the meat; then why not surprise
him by letting him know that you appreciate a
good thing when you get it.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have children who are attending
the public schools. Perhaps their teacher by
patience, tact, and the expenditure of much nerve
force, has succeeded in interesting them in their
studies as they have never been before. Don't
you think it would stimulate her to still greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
effort if you should say to her when you meet:
"My children are doing well at school this term.
They like you and are interested in their work."
No doubt you have often severely criticised teachers,
methods, and school management, and you
have been very free with your words of condemnation.
Why not help a little by some expression
of approval if you can honestly do so.</p>

<p>Give pleasure to your wife, if you have one.
Notice her painstaking efforts to make home comfortable;
compliment her dinner and show that
you appreciate the thousand things she does for
your comfort. There is no greater exhibition of
heroic fortitude than is seen in one who dwells
in a cheerless home she does her best to brighten,
and who wears away the years in an unsatisfied
desire for words and tokens of love and sympathy
which never come to her.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid of giving something of yourself,
of letting yourself out a little; and do not
fear that your heart will run away with your head.
Do not confound sentiment with sentimentalism,
and do not hesitate to praise a thing or an act if
it is really worthy of it. You need to do this for
your own sake as well as for the sake of making
others happy.</p>

<p>"For my own sake," you say. "In what way
will it help me if I bestow praise upon another?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Praise, when it is deserved, is of more importance
to the giver than the receiver.</p>

<p>"Praise does not immediately affect the merit
of him to whom it is awarded," said a writer recently,
"but it does immediately affect the merit
of him to whom its awarding belongs. If a man
deserves praise he is quite as much of a man without
it as with it; but no man can be so much of a
man, nor seem so much of a man, while withholding
just praise as while bestowing it."</p>

<p>In little matters as well as in large ones, to
acknowledge the merit of others is a duty, the
performance of which is even more important to
the one who owes it, than to the one to whom it
is owed. We do not fail to express our appreciation
of heroic deeds, but it is in the common,
everyday life that the words of appreciation are
most sorely needed, and too seldom spoken. Many
a woman would have been greatly cheered and
helped over many hard places, if, while living, she
could have heard half as many nice things said
to her by those she loved, as were put into her
funeral sermon and obituary notice.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a great difference between
the expression of a due and delicate appreciation
of merit, and that false and exaggerated praise
which is dictated by the desire to flatter. The
former is always received with pleasure, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
latter wounds the susceptibility of those on whom
it is lavished. To a mind rightly constituted,
there are few things more painful than undeserved,
or even excessive commendation. Flattery is never
excusable; deserved praise should never be withheld.</p>

<p>Do not be a grumbler. Is there any person more
unwelcome than the chronic growler? When we
meet him he begins by growling about the weather;
then you are entertained with a long account of
his aches and pains, his trials and his losses.
Nothing pleases him. His neighbors are dishonest,
church members are hypocrites, public
officials are, in his estimation, all rascals, law
makers are corrupt, and the country is going to
the dogs. If you speak in commendation of an
individual, he at once attempts to belittle him
in your estimation. If you praise a cause or an
institution, he is sure to find fault with what you
say. He wishes your sympathy for his troubles,
but he has none to give.</p>

<p>We all crave sympathy, but, if we are not careful,
we may exhaust the patience, even of our best
friends, with the recital of our troubles. If your
aches and pains are ever so bad, the best advice
for you is "grin and bear it." It is all very well
to be an interesting invalid for a short time.
Your neighbors will bring you in good things to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
eat, and your friends will bring you pretty flowers
to look at, and books to read, but do not remain
too long in bed if you can help it, and do not
wear too long and sad a face when you are recovering.
It will not relieve your pain at all to tell
everyone you meet how much you suffer, and when
your friends have sympathized with you a dozen
times they become a little tired of it. This advice is
worthy of practice, not for the sake of your friends
only, but for your own. The burden cheerfully
borne becomes light, and any physician knows
that the hopeful, cheerful patient has many more
chances of recovery than the despondent one. In
the lives of us all there are hours of anxiety, disappointment,
pain and vexation; seasons of trial
that are to be met only with stubborn patience.
Greatness of soul is tested by the serenity with
which these inevitable ills are borne and finally
overcome. The little mind will fret and chafe
and fume over little things, even as the petty
stream over its narrow, pebbly bed, while the deep,
strong river moves swiftly and silently over the
boulders that lie at its bottom.</p>

<p>"But," you say, "while the advice is good it is
very hard to follow it." Yes, but it is really harder
not to heed it. "The bird that beats against the
iron bars of its cage suffers more than the patient
captive."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Laugh all you can. It is good for you. Physicians
tell us that laughing has a direct and
positive effect upon one's health. The physical
movement caused by a hearty laugh causes the
arteries to dilate and the flow of blood to hasten,
thus promoting an acceleration of vital processes;
and a mental action through stimulating the blood
vessels of the brain. He who administers medicine
in the shape of wit and humor to the sad heart
is most assuredly a "good Samaritan."</p>

<p>The irresistible, good-humored philosophy of
Mark Twain has relieved the depression and sorrow
of multitudes. He has compelled us to laugh,
and his mission in the world has been a beneficent
one. A cheerful face is as good for an invalid
as pleasant weather. Cheerfulness is health, melancholy
is disease. Cheerfulness is just as natural
to the heart of a man in sound moral and physical
health as color to his cheeks, and wherever
we see habitual gloom we may be sure there is
something radically wrong in the animal economy
or the moral sense.</p>

<p>Sydney Smith once gave a lady two-and-twenty
receipts against melancholy. One was a bright
fire; another, to remember all the pleasant things
said to her; another, to keep a box of sugar plums
on the chimney piece and a kettle simmering on
the hob. These are trivial things in themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
but life is made up of these little pleasures and
none should be neglected because of their seemingly
trifling nature.</p>

<p>If our temperament does not make us naturally
cheerful, we can, at least, cultivate those habits
of body and mind which seem most favorable to
the growth of this condition. We can keep the
mind open to cheerful impressions, and close it
to those that are gloomy. It is far better to
magnify our blessings than to depreciate them.
The Spaniard of whom Southey tells that he always
put on his magnifying glasses when he ate
cherries, in order to make them seem larger, had
the true philosophy of life. So the ancient Pompeiians
seem to have well understood the art of
making the most of everything. Their gardens
were very small, but by painting the surrounding
walls with plants and landscapes their little area
became indefinitely enlarged to the eye of the
observer.</p>

<p>We all know that the outward address of a
person has great influence upon his success both
in the social and the business world. Thousands
of men and women are, in their efforts to please,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
hindered by some personal peculiarity which is
painfully apparent to other people, but of which
they themselves seem wholly ignorant. Thousands
of professional and business men are prevented
from attaining the success they might
reach by some infelicity of manner or speech
which could be remedied by a little painstaking
effort.</p>

<p>Here is a physician who has prepared himself
thoroughly for his profession by years of hard
study and by the expenditure of a considerable
sum of money, but he knows little of human nature,
and but little of the requirements of good
society. He has no tact, and has not thought
it necessary to cultivate that quality. He is
cold and unsympathetic. He has no ability to
make friends or to keep them. He is not sociable,
and he does not make himself agreeable
to his patients by those little kindly acts and
sympathetic speeches so comforting to invalids.
He feels that he is well prepared to practice his
profession, and he regards any personal defects
as of little importance. Other men of less ability,
but with more tact, soon outstrip him in the
race for public favor. He never succeeds in acquiring
a large practice, and, possibly, never
knows the reason why.</p>

<p>A young man applies for a position as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
teacher. He is well equipped in scholarship for
the place he wishes, for he led his class in college,
and he comes highly recommended as a young
man of integrity and earnestness. After a short
interview the superintendent of schools decides
that he is not the man for the position and the
applicant goes away disappointed. Why was he
rejected? Not by reason of poor scholarship, nor
for lack of moral character, but simply on account
of his personal appearance. He was untidy
in his dress. His linen was soiled, his coat
was not brushed, his cuffs were frayed at the
edges, while his finger-nails gave evidence that
he was habitually careless about personal neatness
and cleanliness. The superintendent decided
at once that he did not want him, and the
young man did not know why.</p>

<p>Here is a young woman who is fine looking, intelligent
and accomplished. Apparently she possesses
all those qualities which are necessary to
make her a favorite in society and she seems to
deserve a host of friends. Yet she is not greatly
sought after by her acquaintances, and she has
few firm friends. Young men pay her but little
attention, and seem afraid of her. Other girls,
less brilliant intellectually, with fewer accomplishments,
and with plainer faces, are far
greater favorites in society. Her particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
weakness is that she has allowed herself to fall
into the practice of employing sarcasm to an extent
which is offensive to those with whom she
talks. She has a habit of saying disagreeable,
biting things in a humorous way, and she never
suspects that people are hurt by them. She has
cultivated the habit to such a degree that she
can always raise a laugh at some person's expense,
and she is constantly on the watch for
opportunities to exercise this accomplishment.
Finally it dawns upon her that she does
not hold her friends; that she is sometimes
slighted in the matter of invitations; that she
is not a popular girl, and she doesn't know why.</p>

<p>A certain clergyman is a fine preacher, capable
of attracting, instructing, and inspiring the
most cultivated audiences, but he is shut out
from his proper sphere of usefulness and influence,
and prevented from reaching the position
for which his endowments qualify him, by a
matter which might seem trifling in itself, but
which has become offensive through its persistent
hold upon him. He exhibits a lack of proper
deference to the feelings of others, an arrogant
and unsympathetic tone of voice, and sometimes
yields, under opposition, to unrestrained violence
of language. He betrays his weakness every
time anyone crosses his plans and desires. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
seems hard for him to understand that others
have an equal right to their preference and opinions.
He forgets that while it is easy to be
amiable when everyone agrees with him, the
test of character is in keeping the temper sweet
and reasonable when people differ from him and
criticise him. He understands his power to move
audiences; he is told by persons competent to
judge that his sermons are superior; he knows
that in higher intellectual qualities he surpasses
many other clergymen who secure and retain
prominent positions; yet the painful truth is
forced upon him that his services as a pastor are
not sought for, while inferior preachers are selected
for places of power and influence.</p>

<p>A man goes into trade. He is a shrewd buyer,
energetic, honest, and keeps a good assortment of
goods, but he is not obliging to customers. He
is short and crusty in his speech, irritable and
sometimes almost rude in his manner; consequently
he does not hold his patrons. They
leave him, one by one, and do their purchasing
at other stores where they receive polite attention.
The merchant does not prosper in business,
and he never knows why.</p>

<p>Here is a woman who prides herself upon her
plain speaking. She boasts that when she has
anything to say she is willing to say it to one's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
face, and not behind one's back. She thinks it
is a mark of sincerity and frankness to say disagreeable
things and to bring one's infirmities
to the surface. Her tendencies finally become
fixed habits. She finds herself shunned by her
acquaintances, and she does not know why.</p>

<p>Then there is the loquacious woman, the woman
who monopolizes the conversation, the woman
who has an apparent contempt for paragraph
and punctuation. No matter what the
topic of conversation may be, she at once takes
the management of it into her own hands, and
the other members of the company are made to
feel at once that they are expected to be only
listeners. The loquacious woman may talk well&mdash;she
often does&mdash;but she fails to understand
that there may be such a thing as too much even
of good things, and so she talks on and on, with
an utter disregard for the rights and the comfort
of those around her.</p>

<p>A professional man, who possesses much intellectual
force and originality, takes pride in his
unconventionality in the matter of dress.
His garments are so far from the prevailing
style that they attract attention and invite
comment. He does not realize that the man
who rebels against fashion may be open even
more to the imputation of vanity than he who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
obeys it, because he makes himself conspicuous,
and practically announces that he is wiser than
his associates. An affectation of superior simplicity
is vulgarity.</p>

<p>Stop a moment and recall twenty men and
women of your acquaintance. You will probably
remember that two-thirds of them have some peculiarity,
some defect of speech or manner which
detracts from their social and business success,
or from their usefulness. One is a gossip; another
possesses a hasty temper, while a third
is intellectually dishonest, never yielding his position,
even under the most absolute proof that
he is in the wrong. One of your friends is a
pessimist, and is continually attempting to convert
you to his point of view, while his wife is
so inquisitive that you at once become nervous
when you perceive her approach. A young woman
of your acquaintance would be a most charming
person if she did not laugh too much. A
conversation with her is, upon her part, a perpetual
giggle.</p>

<p>These may generally be good, intelligent, and,
in many respects, charming people, but unfortunately
they are hampered by these deficiencies.
They have become so unconscious of these
personal traits that, doubtless, they would be
greatly surprised were their attention called to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
them. The effect of these shortcomings upon
others is, however, just as unfortunate as if
they were intentionally retained and nourished,
for we usually regard the outward manner as
a true index of the inward emotion.</p>

<p>If so many of our acquaintances display idiosyncrasies
that affect us disagreeably, is it not possible
that we too may be harboring some remediable evil
of temper, some superable infirmity of manner or
of speech which is a bar to our own usefulness,
because distressing to those with whom we are
thrown?</p>

<p>Let us think about this.</p>

<h3>LADY BELLAIR'S ADVICE TO GIRLS.</h3>


<h4>WHAT TO AVOID.</h4>

<p>A loud, weak, affected, whining, harsh or shrill
tone of voice. Extravagances in conversation&mdash;such
phrases as "Awfully this," "Beastly that,"
"Loads of time," "Don't you know," "Hate" for
"dislike," etc.</p>

<p>Sudden exclamations of annoyance, surprise
and joy,&mdash;often dangerously approaching to "female
swearing"&mdash;as "Bother!" "Gracious!"
"How jolly!"</p>

<p>Yawning when listening to anyone.</p>

<p>Talking on family matters, even to bosom
friends.</p>

<p>Attempting any vocal or instrumental piece of
music that you cannot execute with ease.</p>

<p>Crossing your letters.</p>


<p>Making a sharp, short nod with the head, intended
to do duty as a bow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>


<h4>WHAT TO CULTIVATE.</h4>

<p>An unaffected, low, distinct, silver-toned voice.</p>

<p>The art of pleasing those around you, and
seeming pleased with them and all they may do for
you.</p>

<p>The charm of making little sacrifices quite
naturally, as if of no account to yourself.</p>

<p>The habit of making allowances for the
opinions, feelings, or prejudices of others.</p>

<p>An erect carriage&mdash;that is, a sound body.</p>

<p>A good memory for faces, and facts connected
with them&mdash;thus avoiding giving offence through
not recognizing or bowing to people, or saying to
them what had best been left unsaid.</p>

<p>The art of listening without impatience to
prosy talkers, and smiling at the twice-told tale
or joke.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"He who would see his sons and daughters
thoroughly and truly gentle, must forbid selfishness
of action, rudeness of speech, carelessness of
forms, impoliteness of conduct from the first, and
demand that in childhood and the nursery shall
be laid the foundation of that good breeding which
is as a jewel of price to the mature man and
woman."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Many persons consider that 'bad temper' is
entirely voluntary on the part of the person who
displays it. As a matter of fact it is often, to
a very great extent, involuntary, and no one is
more angry at it than the bad tempered person
himself. Of course everyone, whether he is born
with a bad temper or has acquired one from
habit, or has been visited with one as the result
of disease or injury, should at least try to control
it. But his friends should also bear in mind that
bad temper may be, and often is, an affliction to
be sympathized with, not an offence to be punished."</p>

He is not necessarily a better man for having it,

enjoy his own discomfiture. Blessed with this
sense, he is never unduly elated or cast down.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
No one can ruffle his temper. No abuse disturbs
his equanimity. Bores do not bore him. Humbugs
do not humbug him. Solemn airs do not
impose on him. Sentimental gush does not influence
him. The follies of the moment have no
hold on him."</p>

unpleasant truths from his enemies: they are
ready enough to tell them. Good breeding never

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
